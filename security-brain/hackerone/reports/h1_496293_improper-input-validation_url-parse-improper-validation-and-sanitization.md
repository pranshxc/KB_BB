I would like to report Improper Validation and Sanitization in url-parse.

It allows attacker-controlled URL values to bypass validation and sanitization.

# Module

**module name:** url-parse
**version:** 1.4.4
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-parse`

## Module Description

The url-parse method exposes two different API interfaces. The url interface that you know from Node.js and the new URL interface that is available in the latest browsers.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

When using url-parse in the browser the protocol of the URL returned by the parser is not validated correctly. In the Node.js environment strings like, ` javascript:` return and empty string on the resulting URL object, but in the browser the current `document.location.protocol` is used when the provided URL doesn't match the validation expression `/^([a-z][a-z0-9.+-]*:)?(\/\/)?([\S\s]*)/i`.

## Steps To Reproduce:

Add the following `test to test/test.js` and run `npm run test-browser`.

 assume(parse.extractProtocol(' javscript:')).eql({
        slashes: false,
        protocol: '',
        rest: ''
      })

# Wrap up
Line 199 in index.js is setting the protocol to location.protocol, this is probably not the right move.

url protocol = extracted.protocol || location.protocol || '';

> Select Y or N for the following statements:

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: [Y] 
- I opened an issue in the related repository: [N]

## Impact

Bypass input sanitization and validation.
