# [HTA2] Authorization Bypass on https://██████ leaks confidential aircraft/missile information

## Original Report

## Summary:
There is an authorization bypass on https://██████  which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass the "██████Single Sign-On" and view the application as an authenticated user.

## Details:
The host at ████ uses Akamai as a load balancer and routes traffic back to an internal server:

```
root@doggos:~# dig A ████
-- snip --
;; ANSWER SECTION:
███. 2386	IN	CNAME	█████.
████. 1554 IN CNAME ███.
███████. 180 IN CNAME e1010.d.akamaiedge.akamai.█████████.
e1010.d.akamaiedge.akamai.██████.	20 IN A	██████████
``` 

When attempting to hit the website, you are redirected to `https://█████████/pool/sso/authenticate/l/2?m=GET&r=t&u=https%3A%2F%2F████████%2F` and requires the visitor to authenticate via SSO.

However, I was able to find the Origin IP of this server. Hitting this Origin IP completely circumvents the ████████ SSO and allows the visitor to use the application as an authenticated user.

## Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Try visiting the application here: https://███. You'll see you are redirected to login via SSO.

█████████

  2. Run the following command to verify that ████ is the Origin IP for `█████████` by pulling the names from the SSL certificate:

```
root@doggos:~#  true | openssl s_client -connect ██████:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text | perl -l -0777 -ne '@names=/\bDNS:([^\s,]+)/g; print join("\n", sort @names);'

█████████
```

  3. Now visit the application: https://█████
  4. You'll see that you can now use the application as an authenticated user by clicking through the sidebar:

███

You can search through past messages / updates on aircraft and missles here: 

https://███/Guest/MessageSearch.aspx

## Impact

Critical. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can view and download confidential information from this application. For instance, I clicked on one of the messages at https://████████/Guest/MessagesDetails.aspx and it downloaded a document containing sensitive information about some issues with some██████████:

█████████
