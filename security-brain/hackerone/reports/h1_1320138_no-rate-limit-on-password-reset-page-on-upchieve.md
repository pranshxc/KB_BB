## Original Report

## Summary:
Introduction
A little bit about Rate Limit:
A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP-address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache.
In case a client made too many requests within a given timeframe, HTTP-Servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests.
## Description:-
I have identified that when Forgetting Password for account , the request has no rate limit which then can be used to loop through one request. Which can be annoying to the root users sending mass password to one email.

## Steps To Reproduce:

Step 1 - Go To This Link  https://app.upchieve.org/resetpassword
Enter Email Click On  Password reset
Step 2- Intercept This Request In Burp And Forward Till You Found Your Number In Request Like {"email":"your email here"}
POST /auth/reset/send HTTP/1.1

Step 3- Now Send This Request To Intruder And Repeat It 100 Time By Fixing 150 Null payloads.

Step 4 - See You Will Get 200 ok Status Code & many Email In Your INBOX
See It Is Resulting In Mass Mailing Or Email Bombing To Your Users Which Is Bad For Business Impact.


## Recommendations for Fixing/Mitigation

I Will Recommend You To Add A ReCaptcha & Sort Of Something Which Requires Manual Human Interaction To Proceed Like You Can Add Captcha Like 2+2=_ so that it cannot be brute forced and you also can have a limit at the backend for particular number upto 5 times a day user can request Forget Password Email or Link something like that will prevent you from someone exploiting this vulnerability
