## Original Report

target:https://█████/Default.aspx?TabId=81&ctl=SendPassword&returnurl=%252fUOTSHelpDesk

When a user goes on the forget password page and enters a username it is reflected onto the page. An attacker could simply enter a username like <script>alert(1)</script> and it would execute an alert not to mention there is no csrf protection allowing a attacker to possibly chain csrf with this and cause alot of harm.
