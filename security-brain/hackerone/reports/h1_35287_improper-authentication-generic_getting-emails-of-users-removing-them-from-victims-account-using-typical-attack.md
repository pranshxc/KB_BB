## Original Report

Hey Hi, 

I would like to explain a typical type of attack combined with a brute force attack leading to email disclosure. 
conditions : should be having email notifications ON .

Every time someone follows me , favs my tweet i get a notification on my email, and the footer of the email . click here if this email is not signed up.

https://twitter.com/account/not_my_account/[account_name]/D26H5-DAH4C-141579

Every notification email has a different unique Code.
But the probability of getting the right is very LOW.
But when we send 1000 email notifications to the victim(by fav and un-fav continuously on a particular tweet )  
the probability decreases a bit, and when the email notifications are increased the probability of getting the right code gets HIGH!

chances of getting the right code ∝ number of notification emails.

This whole process can be simply automated using PHP or python, making it more easy.

Faults in the system:

1) a unique code is generated every time, 5 secs 5 notification emails = 5 different codes.
      Fix suggested: The code generated should be the same for like next 1 hour

2)  The code doesn't expire.  i dig'd into one of my old twitter notification emails and seen that the code is still active.
        Fix suggested : Expire tokens ASAP!

3)  Getting the right discloses the email. whenever i get the right code, the email is disclosed.
              For example: for username @test entering the right code discloses
              "If you did not sign up for the Twitter account "test", please confirm so that we may remove your                  email address test@gmail.com from this account. "
      Fix suggested : use *** instead
something like te****@gmail.com

4) if a user removes an email , the code should immediately  get expired .
    if we hit the right code it still discloses the old email.
something like this:
"Your email has been removed.
Your email (test@live.com) has been removed from the Twitter account "test".

You will no longer receive Twitter notifications intended for this account."


Thanks,
Karthik
