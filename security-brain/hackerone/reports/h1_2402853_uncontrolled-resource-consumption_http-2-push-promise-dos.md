## Original Report

## Summary:
In `discard_newhandle` the condition in the `if` statement is always `false` for http transfer due to a negation.
As a result `http2_data_done` will never be called.
```
static void discard_newhandle(struct Curl_cfilter *cf,
                              struct Curl_easy *newhandle)
{
  if(!newhandle->req.p.http) {
    http2_data_done(cf, newhandle, TRUE);
    newhandle->req.p.http = NULL;
  }
  (void)Curl_close(&newhandle);
}
```

`discard_newhandle` is supposed to close stream and free resources allocated in `http2_data_setup` 
as well as close `Curl_easy` handle when some error occurs in `push_promise`.
For example if `PUSH_PROMISE` frame has invailid `:scheme` pseudo header `set_transfer_url` in `push_promise` will return an error.
```
    rv = set_transfer_url(newhandle, &heads);
    if(rv) {
      discard_newhandle(cf, newhandle);
      rv = CURL_PUSH_DENY;
      goto fail;
    }
```
An attacker could send specially crafted `PUSH_PROMISE` frames to trigger the error.
This would result in a memory leak for every malformed frame received, consequently using all available memory. 



## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. compile `nghttp2` with {F3099706} applied
  1. compile {F3099707}
  1. run `nghttpd -p/=/foo.bar --no-tls 8181`
  1. run `valgrind --leak-check=full ./http2_push_headers`

for each `-p` option `nghttpd` will send 200 `PUSH_PROMISE` frames with invalid `:scheme` header

## Supporting Material/References:

`valgrind --leak-check=full ./http2_push_headers` output:
