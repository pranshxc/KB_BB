# [bot.brew.sh] Full Path Disclosure

## Metadata

## Original Report

Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection) query to view the page source, require the attacker to have the full path to the file they wish to view.

The affected domain has a logging instance that discloses the full operating system path on certain pages. 

Affected URLs:
 - https://bot.brew.sh/job/Homebrew%20Bottles/lastFailedBuild/logText/progressiveText?start=0
 - https://bot.brew.sh/job/Homebrew%20Bottles/*


It was possible to discover the path where the brew distrobution server is installed as can be seen in the output below:

# Recommendation
Implement basic authentication to protect the root folder, alternatively remove the offending files causing the stack trace errors.
