# Vulnerability

ReDoS  (Catastrophic backtracking)

## Vulnerability Description
> An attacker can make wappalyzer (all drivers, like browser extension and cli) stop working due to ReDoS in one of it's services regex . 

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Create a web page with the following tag:
`<meta name="GENERATOR" content="IMPERIA 46197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197946197966228761662296:"/>`
2. Now open this page using wappalyzer extension in browser or it's cli
3. Wappalyzer will stop answering and it's CPU percentage will start to  increase to high levels

## Patch

 In order to test this issue, you can see that the problem resides in this line `https://github.com/AliasIO/wappalyzer/blob/master/src/apps.json#L13207` of wappalyzer application. When this regex test the input shown, it takes process the application indefinitely, making it stop working. Running it in browser extension completely crash the extension in all tabs, and in cli/node version the execution takes forever.

To patch this issue, the current regex must be changed to a more restrict one in this piece: `([0-9.]{2,})+`
