## Original Report

## Summary:
Weak protection against brute-forcing on login API: https://api.outpost.co/api/v1/login leads to account takeover on https://www.teamoutpost.com/
## Steps To Reproduce:
* Sign in on https://www.teamoutpost.com/
███
* redirect to https://app.outpost.co/sign-in to login
█████████
* test any login credentials and review the request to https://api.outpost.co/api/v1/login
███████
* Notice the difference between the wrong user "Username does not exist" and wrong password " Password does not match username" 
████
* first we need to brute-force on username to get some valid usernames 
█████████
* We can grep on "Username does not exist" 
██████
* Here is valid usernames without  "Username does not exist"
██████████
* Notice the API doesn't block me for many requests even I reached more than 33K request and continue 
████
* after we exported a list of valid usernames we can brute-force for password fore every username on the list
██████████
* I imported valid usernames as 1st payload 
██████
* for 2nd payload I can use a passwords list but I tried the simplest password that user can register with " 9 characters long "
███████
* we got some credentials even with ADMIN role
██████████
