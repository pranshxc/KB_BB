## Original Report

## Summary:
I started testing for unrestricted file uploads and quickly discovered a way to upload a corrupted file into Reddit. I was able to bypass the MIME type of uploaded files first by uploading a normal PNG file to Reddit, intercepting the request with burp, and changing the content type from `image/png` to `image/svg+xml`, then changing the content of the PNG image to an SVG file which is intended for Stored XSS. The file successfully uploads and I receive a 201 created message back. When trying to upload there is infinite loading time and the post never actually gets posted, but I found a way to bypass this, first, you upload a completely normal PNG file and after it uploads, you do the aforementioned steps to upload an unrestricted file and you can successfully post the corrupted image. When clicking on the post the message `processing image...` appears and the file never loads.
Now comes the Web Cache Poisoning which ultimately leads to a complete DoS on the Reddit Home page. Once the corrupted image has been posted this will affect every user that follows the account that posted it, there is a full DoS that requires **NO user interaction** `Something went wrong. Just don't panic` appears as well as another error message saying `We weren't able to load posts for this page`. If the attacker wants to create more impact he can feed the URL to users who do not follow him.
{F1010810}
 This issue is so persistent that a user can reload the page, close it and open it again, close the browser, log out and log back in, and they still won't be able to access Reddit. This issue becomes even more persistent if a victim follows the attacker or the account posting it, the victim can try to clear the cache, clear cookies, restart the browser but the issue will still be there, there is no way of getting rid of it.


## Steps To Reproduce:

1. As an attacker, click on 'Create Media Post' on the home screen
2.  First choose your profile to post the corrupted image
3. Add a title as usual and **first upload a normal png image** this is a very important step
4. After doing so click on the + sign next to the image you just uploaded and select a normal PNG image
5. Intercept the request within Burp
6. Navigate to `Content-Type:` parameter and replace `image/png` with `image/svg+xml`
7. Replace the content of the PNG image with an SVG file code, I specifically used the following code: 
```

8. Forward the request and notice the 201 created message
9. Post the images

In this video, I demonstrate how if a user follows or is already following the attacker account the DoS is present:

## Impact

Web cache poisoning and complete denial of service, an attacker can achieve this **without user interaction** there is no way of getting rid of it, an attacker only has to deploy an attack to deny service to Reddit. In some cases I'm not able to even reach Reddit, the site won't load at all. This was tested in the following browsers: 
Firefox
Safari
Opera
For some reason, the behavior is not present in Google Chrome. But any other browser will work.
