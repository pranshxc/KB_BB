## Original Report

Description
-----------------
A heap overflow vulnerability can be triggered by
an integer overflow vulnerability,
which exists in PHP-7.1.0 due to missing overflow check
in a function php_implode() in ext/standard/string.c

I believe this could lead memory leak to the string if
carefully exploited with using global addresses
in the binary (e.g., GOT entries, heap addresses, etc.).

The bug happens on the line of ext/standard/string.c:1249,
upon calling zend_string_alloc().
Both %eax and %ecx can be controllable by the exploit.

str = zend_string_alloc(len + (numelems - 1) * ZSTR_LEN(delim), 0);

This is only triggered in 32bit machines.

PoC Exploit
-----------------
<?php
  $arr = [];
  for($i=0;$i<65536; ++$i) {
     $arr[$i]= "aa";
  }
  $text1 = str_repeat("ABCD", 16384);
  // Changing ABCD into other values will alter %eax and %ecx.
  $str = implode($text1, $arr);
?>

# Run this script with php version over 7.0

The attacker can control both %eax & %ecx for the arbitrary value.
The instruction is on moving the content at memory pointed by $eax to the memory address at $edx.
If it is carefully controlled, that copy of string operation can applied over a GOT addresses or sensitive areas to leak the data into PHP string variable.
