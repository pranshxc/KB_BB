## Original Report

NOTE: I am making this email as I think the response from Coinbase originally, via my emails to them was not correct. They had not acknowledged that this flaw allowed for user enumeration and hence I am posting the report again - in hope of a proper and well evaluated response.

The key security issue however, is that after x amount of email addresses are sent requests for money (rate limiting issue, using coinbase email for spam), the users which are members of coinbase can be differentiated between non-members.

Additionally, there is further information disclosure, as the first and last name of the coinbase users email address is also disclosed.

Hence I believe the following impacts are:

1. Unlimited money request emails, spam

2. Email Address / User enumeration on Coinbase

3. Information Disclosure of Coinbase Accounts (First and Last name)

    Steps to reproduce the issue or a proof of concept

To reproduce the vulnerability:

1. Login to Coinbase.

2. Visit https://coinbase.com/transactions

3. Click the Request Money button at the top

4. In the from field, insert a coinbase user accounts email address: e.g. ████

5. The rest of the fields can be entered in as usual

6. Click the Request Money button

7. In this stage, capture the request using a proxy, e.g. Burp Suite

8. If done correctly, the request should look like the following:

    POST /transactions/request_money HTTP/1.1
    Host: coinbase.com

9. This request can now be replayed unlimited times, with unlimited email addresses inputted. Coinbase does not limit the rate of POST requests to /transactions/request_money
10. After x number of requests are sent to /transactions/request_money, visit /transactions/
11. It can be identified that those who are NOT members of Coinbase, show up as email addresses only, whereas those WHO ARE members of Coinbase, show up as Full Names. --> Email Address / User Account enumeration
12. Furthermore, the coinbase members whose emails are identified, have their full names disclosed to the attacker. Information Leakage

I have attached a GIF showing this entire process. I attempted 80 email addresses, 5 threads simultaneously via Burp Suite Intruder. Either download the GIF attached in this email, or visit http://uppix.net/0XKQ4v.gif.

Thanks for your time,
