## Original Report

**Summary:**

I take username:\\\"jobert\\\" , hi @jobert

`Result "total_count":27`

You have 27 private programs in which you have added through the new system - using /invite/token

Yes , most likely you have more number of private programs, but those that are missing, you most likely added by the old system.
