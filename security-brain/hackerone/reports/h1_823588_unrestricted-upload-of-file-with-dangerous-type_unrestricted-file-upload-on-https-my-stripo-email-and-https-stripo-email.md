## Impact

The consequences of unrestricted file upload can vary, including complete system takeover, an overloaded file system or database, forwarding attacks to back-end systems, and simple defacement.Here is the list of attacks that the attacker might do:
--Compromise the web server by uploading and executing a web-shell which can run commands, browse system files, browse local resources, attack 
   other servers, and exploit the local vulnerabilities, and so forth.
--Put a phishing page into the website.
--Put a permanent XSS into the website.
--Bypass cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy and exfiltrate potentially sensitive data.
--Upload a file using malicious path or name which overwrites critical file or personal data that other users access. For example; the attacker might --- 
--replace the .htaccess file to allow him/her to execute specific scripts.
