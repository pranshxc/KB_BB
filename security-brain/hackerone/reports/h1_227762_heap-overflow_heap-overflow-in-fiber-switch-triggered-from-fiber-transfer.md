## Original Report

It appears as if my recommendations were ignored in the GitHub issue, so I've repeated the issue here.

# PoC

	Fiber.new{}.transfer(
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
		0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
		0,0,0,0,0)

# Explanation
The cause of this is that in mrbgems/mruby-fiber/src/fiber.c the stack Fiber stack is initialized lines 90-96 to a default of 64 (FIBER_STACK_INIT_SIZE), however in fiber_switch lines 191-198, if the Fiber's status is currently MRB_FIBER_CREATED, then it will copy the arguments provided from fiber_transfer irregardless of whether or not there are more arguments than 64 (the PoC doesn't need ~127 arguments, anything 64 or above will work!). The quick fix would be to make sure that theres not more than 64 arguments passed to fiber_transfer.

# Solution

	diff --git a/mrbgems/mruby-fiber/src/fiber.c b/mrbgems/mruby-fiber/src/fiber.c
	index bd1d09d4..2d0fc39a 100644
