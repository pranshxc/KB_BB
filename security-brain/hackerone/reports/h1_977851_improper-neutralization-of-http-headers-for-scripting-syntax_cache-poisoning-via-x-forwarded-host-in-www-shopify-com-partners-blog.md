## Original Report

Hello, run in loop requests with```  X-Forwarded-Host: your_hackerz_site.com ``` - after some time You will notice in response ``` your_hackerz_site.com ```

{F981839}

now remove ``` X-Forwarded-Host  ``` - there still be our url:

{F981841}

i've logged to my VPS to verify this bug and downloaded poisoned page (https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/7-web-design-and-development-awards-you-should-enter) , it's contains links to collabolator:

{F981844}

{F981845}

Looks like there is no URL keys so i stopped testing cause i'm breaking site functionally, but it was be worth to check if we can poison  ```  X-Forwarded-Host : foobar.pl"><img src=x onerror=blah> ``` or try use other headers, if i get permission i can try other vectors on a older article to prevent distributing users.

## Impact

poisoning links, eg. FB share button:
