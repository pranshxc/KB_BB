## Original Report

## Summary:
Team member with role USER can change data of any user in the team, or steal his cookies, or steal the account of victim via forget password function.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Login in as user1 (the user with role `admin`) and invite user2 (set his role to `user`).
  2. Login in as user2, open Mail tab and select user1 from `Conversation assignment` dropdown (see F796149 attachment).
  3. Open network tools in the browser devTools or open local proxy and copy `UserUuid` (`da4f313f-e21e-4b5f-b2da-42d9864716f6` in my case) of the user1 from the following request: https://api.outpost.co/api/v1/conversation/assigned?assignedToUserUuid=da4f313f-e21e-4b5f-b2da-42d9864716f6.
  4. Use template `request1` to create http request. Change `{user1-uuid}` to user1 Uuid, `{user2-cookie}` to user2 cookie. In the request body: `{attacker-email}` to email controlled by user2, `signature` to the following: `<p style=\"margin:0;\">User Signature2<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie) ></p>`. Send request.
  5. Login in as user1. Open https://app.outpost.co/settings/preferences, alert with user1 cookie will appear (see F796148 attachment).
  6. Open https://app.outpost.co/sign-in/help and paste `{attacker-email}`. Open email client, click the link to restore password, enter a new password. Now you can login in using user1 email address and password entered on the previos step.
