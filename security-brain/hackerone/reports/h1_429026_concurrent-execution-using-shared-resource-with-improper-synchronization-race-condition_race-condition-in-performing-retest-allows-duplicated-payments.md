## Original Report

## Summary

There exists a race condition in performing retests. By executing multiple requests to confirm a retest at the same time, a malicious user is paid multiple times for the retest. This allows for stealing money from HackerOne, which could go unnoticed by both HackerOne and the attacker (me).

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Receive a retest request email from HackerOne.
2. Intercept the request to retest the email. Right click the request in Burp Suite and select `Copy as curl command`.
3. Execute the request on the command line in the form `(request) & (request) & ...`. In testing, I executed the command 5 times.
4. Scroll to the bottom of https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties. The payment will appear under the `Retest payments` sections and may be repeated.
5. Wait a few weeks. If successful, a callback from HackerOne will be received (in this case from @michiel):

    {F366191}

6. Check your bank account statements. Observe that a $500 payment was sent from HackerOne 2 weeks ago, demonstrating that the race condition was successful:

{F366192}

## Impact

This allows an attacker to exploit the retesting feature to steal many times more money. Given that this went unnoticed by both the attacker and HackerOne for over 2 weeks, this has the potential to be exploited multiple times to steal money from HackerOne.
