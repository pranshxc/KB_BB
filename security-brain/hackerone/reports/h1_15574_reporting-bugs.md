## Original Report

1)This page allows visitors to upload files to the server. Various web applications allow users to upload files (such as pictures, images, sounds, ...). Uploaded files may pose a significant risk if not handled correctly. A remote attacker could send a multipart/form-data POST request with a specially-crafted filename or mime type and execute arbitrary code.
Affected items
/artists 
If the uploaded files are not safely checked an attacker may upload malicious files.
Restrict file types accepted for upload: check the file extension and only allow certain files to be uploaded. Use a whitelist approach instead of a blacklist. Check for double extensions such as .php.png. Check for files without a filename like .htaccess (on ASP.NET, check for configuration files like web.config). Change the permissions on the upload folder so the files within it are not executable. If possible, rename the files that are uploaded.

2)When a new name and password is entered in a form and the form is submitted, the browser asks if the password should be saved. Thereafter when the form is displayed, the name and password are filled in automatically or are completed as the name is entered. An attacker with local access could obtain the cleartext password from the browser cache.
Affected items
/login 
/register 
Possible sensitive information disclosure
The password auto-complete should be disabled in sensitive applications. 
To disable auto-complete, you may use a code similar to: 
<INPUT TYPE="password" AUTOCOMPLETE="off">
