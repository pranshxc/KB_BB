## Original Report

Manipulating an order request JSON object, containing an additional item with a negative quantity directly manipulates the total amount of the order.

In the following JSON request, an order is submitted for 2 ChickenBurgers ($12 each), as well as -1 BreadPuddings ($9 each).

The total price after tax calculates as $18.70 and is accepted by the system. The attached screenshots show the previous orders, indicating that only $18.70 was charged for the transaction.
