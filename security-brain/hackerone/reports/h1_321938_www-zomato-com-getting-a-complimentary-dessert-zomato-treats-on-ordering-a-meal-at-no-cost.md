## Original Report

1. Go to order food tab and select any restaurant that delivers online.
2. Add Zomato Treat Subscription to cart.
3. Add more items to cart to fulfil the minimum order requirement for that restaurant.
4. Click on Continue and proceed to pay online.
5. While paying online I faced the issue that "some items in your cart have been changed" and was unable to pay. If you face the same issue toggle between Card Payment and Netbanking 1-2 times and then pay via Netbanking.

6. The item id on the separate line is the id corresponding to Zomato Treats with a price of Rs.149. On trying more item_ids, I figured out that there are more order ids for Zomato Treats, and have a price of 0.

7. I changed the item_id to 18, the unit_cost to 0, and subtracted 149(Zomato Treats Cost) from the total cost. Initial total cost: 254, final total cost: 105.

8. So ,the new payload becomes:
