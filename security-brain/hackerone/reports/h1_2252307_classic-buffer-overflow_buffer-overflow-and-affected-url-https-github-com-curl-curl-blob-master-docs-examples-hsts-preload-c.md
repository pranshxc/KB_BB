# Buffer overflow and affected url:-https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/examples/hsts-preload.c

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 2252307
- Weakness: Classic Buffer Overflow
- Program: curl
- Disclosed At: 2023-11-15T10:10:19.471Z
- Has Bounty: No
- Visibility: full
- Substate: not-applicable

## Original Report

## Summary:
A buffer overflow, also known as a buffer overrun, occurs when a program or process attempts to write more data to a buffer than the buffer is allocated to hold. This can happen if the program does not properly check the length of the data before writing it to the buffer, or if the program allocates too little space for the buffer.

## Steps To Reproduce:
[add details for how we can reproduce the issue]

1. The hstsread function in the provided code does not properly check the length of the host string before copying it into the e->name buffer. This could lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the application.this could exploited by a malicious domain or website whose url should be long enough to overflow buffer as it's using strcpy function 
Condition a malicious preload host is required to exploit this if it's meet government can use it for zero click attack

Recommendation:

The hstsread function should be modified to check the length of the host string before copying it into the e->name buffer. If the string is too long, the function should return an error code

Here is the vulnerable code if attacker or government manipulate developer to add a very long domain name in  hsts_preload then this will result remote code execution

## Impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject arbitrary code into the application. This could allow the attacker to take control of the application and perform actions on behalf of the user.
