## Original Report

##Summary:
In your sub-domain: https://demo.weblate.org/ , there's an endpoint that doesn't have any rate limit on it to prevent spamming you by filling the contact you form multiple times to bomb you with tons of emails.

##Description:
Spamming and Possible DOS is being possible due to missing rate limit on this endpoint.

**Request**
POST /contact/ HTTP/1.1
Host: demo.weblate.org

**Suggested Fix**
Implement additional checking per API request such as a unique token or identifier that changes per request to prevent mass spamming, additional Rate limiting measures can be implemented such as IP blacklisting, or account banning if a certain amount of requests are made.

##Steps To Reproduce:
1- Visit https://demo.weblate.org/contact/?t=reg
2- Fill the form, send it and intercept the request
3- Using burp intruder mass replay the request.

Thank you.
