## Original Report

## Summary:
Description
Hi there !
I noticed when we hit the /reset-password-request/ endpoint too many times via some proxy for e.g:- (Burp) there is no rate limit on that endpoint and you can spam the email with 100’s of requests and resend even more password reset emails to the users as there is no rate limiting on that.
I tried this on this /reset-password-request/ endpoint and like I said I was successful for sending ~10and was even able to send like 10+ request to the user for password reset requests
I have identified that when Forgetting Password for account , the request has no rate limit which then can be used to loop through one request. Which can be annoying to the root users sending mass password to one email.
## Steps To Reproduce:
Step 1-Go To This Link https://app.upchieve.org/resetpassword Enter Email Click On Forget Password
step 2- Intercept This Request In Burp And Forward Till You Found Your Number In Request Like {"user":{"email":"██████████"}}
```
POST /auth/reset/send HTTP/2

Send it to the intruder and repeat it by 50 times
You will get 200 OK status
I already attached the PoC video too if you don't understand my explanation
