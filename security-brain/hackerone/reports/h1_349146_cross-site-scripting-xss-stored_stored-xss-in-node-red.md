## Original Report

I would like to report a stored XSS in node-red
It allows to execute javascript in the user's browser

# Module

**module name:** node-red
**version:** v0.18.4
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red`

## Module Description

> A visual tool for wiring the Internet of Things.

## Module Stats

1,758 downloads in the last day
10,601 downloads in the last week
40,000+ downloads in the last month

# Vulnerability
## Steps To Reproduce:

* Install the module

`sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red`

* Run it
`node-red`
then access it in http://localhost:1880

* Exploit
The same payload can be applied in different locations.
Payload: `<script>alert('xss')</script>`
Places where you can put the payload:
Drag & drop any item from the left menu to the center then put the payload in the `name` field. After clicking "done", the xss is triggered. At this point it's only triggered in your browser.
Click the "deploy" button, now any user that will browse to  http://localhost:1880 will have the javascript executed.
Second one:
Click the "+" button on the top right to create a new "flaw". Put the payload in the name field. Again you need to press "deploy". After that double clicking on the "flaw" will execute the javascript.
