## Original Report

I figured out that when there is configuration of smtp then the user can reveal the full path of the website when booking an appointment.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Go to calendar and create and appointment.
2. Now visit that appointment with burp proxy on.
3. Select time and try to book the appointment.
4. Following request will be observed
```
POST /index.php/apps/calendar/appointment/9/book HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/json
requesttoken: <token>
Content-Length: 138
Origin: http://129.146.173.97
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Cookie:<any valid-cookie>

{"start":1674205200,"end":1674205500,"displayName":"attackerbikram","email":"ohp@gmail.com","description":"","timeZone":"UTC"}
```
5. We will get following response
```
