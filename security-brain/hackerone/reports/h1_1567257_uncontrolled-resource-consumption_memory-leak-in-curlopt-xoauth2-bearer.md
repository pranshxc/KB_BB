# Memory leak in CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 1567257
- Weakness: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
- Program: curl
- Disclosed At: 2022-05-13T07:51:23.154Z
- Has Bounty: No
- Visibility: full
- Substate: informative

## Original Report

## Summary:
Once a bearer token is set with `CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER`, each HTTP request done with the same handler leaks the token itself.

## Steps To Reproduce:

Given the following code:

```c
#include <curl/curl.h>

int main(void) {
  curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_ALL);

  CURL* curl = curl_easy_init();

  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH, CURLAUTH_BEARER);
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER, "c4e448d652a961fda0ab64f882c8c161d5985f805d45d80c9ddca108f8e2fde3");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_HTTPGET, 1L);
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://andrea.pappacoda.it");

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    curl_easy_perform(curl);
  }

  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);

  curl_global_cleanup();
}
```

AddressSanitizer reports a memory leak:

## Supporting Material/References:

As mentioned in curl's SECURITY-PROCESS.md, "small memory leaks" do not account for vulnerabilities, but as I describe below this leak can be triggered multiple times very easily. I thus preferred reporting this in private form to be on the safe side.

Some more info about my environment:

```text

```

I can also confirm that the issue is still present in the latest master (commit 1ddc8aefb2e45def02dfe02973a3afd2fbdf09c3) - and this time as curl has been built from source AddressSanitizer is able to provide a more helpful error message:

```text

## Impact

As bearer tokens don't have a standardized length, applications usually don't impose limits on it. If a user is able to set a big bearer token and perform an arbitrary number of meaningless requests it could slowly eat up all system's memory.

In particular, substituting the bearer string literal with a user-supplied input (let's say `argv[1]`) an attacker could pass in a token as large as roughly 45 kilobytes, which would result in 45 kilobytes of leaked memory on each request that could sum up to hundreds or thousands of megabytes on long-running services. This could eventually lead to the service being killed by the OOM killer, as well as slow downs of overall system performance, especially in constrained environments.

The example reported above, if substituting `argv[1]` to the literal and simulating a high number of requests with a for loop, leads to the following memory usage:

```text
$ cc -g -fsanitize=address main_args.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libcurl) -o asan_args && time ./asan_args $(openssl rand -hex 23000)
=================================================================

    #1 0x7f55141fa3cd  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4+0x673cd)

./asan_args $(openssl rand -hex 23000)  7,62s user 0,74s system 8% cpu 1:36,56 total
```

This example is taken to the extreme, but 40 MiB in one minute and a half is a big amount of leaked memory nonetheless.

It is also worth noting that the leaked data is fairly sensitive, as bearer tokens are widely used for authentication in a variety of places (e.g. REST APIs).
