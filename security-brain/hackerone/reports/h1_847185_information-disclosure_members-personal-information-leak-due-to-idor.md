## Original Report

##Summary
https://██████ allows anyone to sign up and view other members profile.  According to wikipedia,  ███████ is part of US DoD "████████":

██████

I signed up with a regular account and noticed that by referencing users `████`, I can send thousands of "█████████"  and also, using another end-point, view personal information of members. 

For eg. this person has all her private info displayed for any member:  https://█████/███████ her `██████████` is easily enumerated as `██████████`. 



███


Therefore,  using Burp, I can run this number to reveal more members:

## Browser Response

███


Not all members provide Personal Info to anyone, therefore, I used another endpoint to craft a simple message "█████████", I used Burp and send thousands of "██████" to different `█████████` and wait for them to accept:


##Request


███████

and I wait for those that accept my "██████████" and I should be able to see their Personal Info upon approval.

I can confirmed that they had received my request because, using the first end-point, their `█████████` is `Pending....`__after__ I had sent the "████".

## Impact

This technique can be used as a data harvesting method on ██████ website to retrieve members profile, I had noticed that many of the members are military personnel. Which can be of interest for terrorist or threat actors targeting US military personnel for phishing or espionage campaigns. 

##Fix
There should be some rate-limiting to the number of requests per end-point can receive from a single source ip addr or a reCAPTCHA after a few requests to stop attacker from harvesting members' profile.
