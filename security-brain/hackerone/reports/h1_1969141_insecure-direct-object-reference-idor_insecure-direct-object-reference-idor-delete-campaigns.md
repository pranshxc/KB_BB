## Original Report

**Summary:**
Hi Team, 

I think I can delete any Campaigns based on campaign_id


### Steps To Reproduce

````

Decode base64 of campaign_id to get **gid://hackerone/Campaign/244**

Increase or decrease the number after Campaign and re-encode it with base64

At the campaign_id parameter in the request change it to another program's ongoing campaign_id parameter.

Then send Campaign request of any program to be deleted.

## Impact

Can delete all Campaign on hackerone or any program
