Information disclosure is when a web application fails to properly protect confidential information, which causes revealing sensitive information or data of the users or anything related to users to any third party.

## Summary:
Am able to get any MTN users data such as FULL NAME, CUSTOMER TYPE AND PICTURE.
I can get those data by using only phone number of any MTN users.

## Impact

An attacker can retrieve any users data (like full name, Customer Type, and Picture) by just using the victim phone number.
This can be use for information gathering about someone for malicious use or criminal activity.
