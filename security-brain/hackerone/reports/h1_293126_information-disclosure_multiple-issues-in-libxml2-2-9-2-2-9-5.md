## Original Report

Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project. Due to its flexible C implementation and continuous development, Libxml2 is known to be very portable, the library builds and works on a variety of systems (Linux, Unix, Windows, CygWin, MacOS, MacOS X, RISC Os, OS/2, VMS, QNX, MVS, VxWorks, ...). It is or has been adopted by many major vendors or products including Google (Chrome), VMWare, Apple (Safari, Mac OSX, iOS, ...), and many embedded systems. As in the [Google Patch Rewards](https://www.google.com.sg/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards) , Libxml2 is listed in the category of core infrastructure data parsers.

From 2015-2016, our fuzzing work on Libxml2 has systematically identified a sequence of bugs including use-after-free, out-of-bound read, infinite recursions, they are submitted to both Libxml2 and Apple (which internally maintains a highly-synchronized branch of the official Libxml2), some of the bugs are resolved in recent releases, including the following:

[CVE-2017-16932](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-16932): Libxml2 Parameter Entity Infinite Recursion Vulnerability
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=759579
https://github.com/GNOME/libxml2/commit/899a5d9f0ed13b8e32449a08a361e0de127dd961

Much efforts of patch work should be attributed to Daniel Veillard (Libxml2 developer), David Kilzer (Apple), Pranjal Jumde (Apple), Nick Wellnhofer and possibly others.

## Impact

Exploitability subject to context, especially when the parser is exposed to external XML. In some situations if the XML engine is used in conjunction with a JS engine, exploitation could be easier.
