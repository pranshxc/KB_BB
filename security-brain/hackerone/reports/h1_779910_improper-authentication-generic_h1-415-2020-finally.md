thanks for reading this far!! I hope you like my writeup, and may I be the winner.
lmao, I'm kidding, I'm only submitting this because it took me like 40 hours to finish this CTF.
(from which a lot consisted of frustration and depression because of the 80% downtime or the core functions not working :( )

Not doing an actual write-up since I got some hints from 2 friends of mine, so I didn't 100% do this on my own.
may Bayo and Jllis be the winners.
BBAC represent :muscle:
