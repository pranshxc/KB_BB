## Original Report

This bug was reported directly to php:

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68799

It has been patched in the 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 branch.

5.4 branch
http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=2fc178cf448d8e1b95d1314e47eeef610729e0df

5.5 branch
http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=55001de6d8c6ed2aada870a76de1e4b4558737bf

5.6 branch
http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=21bc7464f454fec18a9ec024c738f195602fee2a

If an attacker can gain determinism in the heap, he/she can cause PHP to call free() on an arbitrary pointer. This can lead to a variety of outcomes, including RCE.

In my bug writeup, I demonstrated a PoC which showed control over the value which free() was called on.

The bug report has now been made public by PHP. Additionally, PHP 5.5.21 was released today. This release publicly discloses the issue and corresponding CVE by the php project maintainers.

Please let me know if this qualifies for a bug bounty, or if there are any other details I need to provide.
