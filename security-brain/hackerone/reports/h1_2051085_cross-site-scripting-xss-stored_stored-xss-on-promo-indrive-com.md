# Stored XSS on promo.indrive.com

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 2051085

## Original Report

## Summary:
The functionality on https://promo.indrive.com/promocodes allows drivers to find and activate promocodes. It requires a driver ID. When user activates their promocode, the browser makes a POST request to https://id.indrive.com/api/spreadsheet/promocodes with parameters **id** (driver id) and **activationDate** (the date of the promocode activation). It is possible for an attacker to set parameter **activationDate** value to an XSS payload. When a user inputs the same ID when looking for promocodes, the XSS payload will trigger, executing arbitrary JavaScript code in the victims's browser.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Make a POST request to https://id.indrive.com/api/spreadsheet/promocodes with the following body: 
```
{"id":"4","activationDate":"<script>alert(1)</script>"}
```
{F2470829}
The driver ID value of **4** is used, but the attacker can enumerate through valid driver IDs to inject the payload into every user's promocode.
2. Go to https://promo.indrive.com/promocodes
3. Input a driver ID (in my example **4**) and click "Проверить ID". The XSS payload will be triggered

## Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in any user's browser.
Despite this being a retired functionality, an attacker could trick users to try and get a promocode.
This could also potentially make promocodes usable infinite amount of times by directly making POST requests to renew the code every 24 hours.
