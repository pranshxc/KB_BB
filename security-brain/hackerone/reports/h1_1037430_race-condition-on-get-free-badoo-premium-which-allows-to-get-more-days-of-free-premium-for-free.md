## Original Report

##Summary: 
On Badoo when a user wants to delete his account it prompts for a Free 3 days premium or the user can proceed to delete his account. But when user choose to get free 3 day premium he can click `Get free Badoo Premium` and can enjoy free premium for three days, Here i found a race condition vulnerability through which i was able to get more than three days of premium. 

On the time of testing I  got  3 successful request  which got me 9 days of premium instead of  3 (where 1 week of premium costs about 5$) . And by increasing Number of connections an attacker can get even more days of premium.
