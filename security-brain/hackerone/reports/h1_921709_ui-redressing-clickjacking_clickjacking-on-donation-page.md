## Original Report

## Description:

Vulnerable URL: https://wordpressfoundation.org/donate/

Clickjacking on the vulnerable URL allows an attacker to redirect a victim to do a donation at an attacker's page.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1)  To test whether the page is vulnerable to clickjacking or not use this code

<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5">
<title>i Frame</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h1>THIS PAGE IS VULNERABLE TO CLICKJACKING</h1>
<iframe src="https://wordpressfoundation.org/donate/" frameborder="0 px" height="1200px" width="1920px"></iframe>
</center>
</body>
</html>

2) To test whether an attacker is able to trick the victim to donate money to the attacker's payment gateway
             i) Open the attached page "donation.html "
             ii) Click on the button give once
             iii) The page will be redirected to the attacker's PayPal money request page.

*Sorry for the bad UI and please remove my payment-request id after the vulnerability check from donation.html page.

## Recommendations

Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'  (The page cannot be displayed in a frame, regardless of the site attempting to do so.)
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self' (The page can only be displayed in a frame on the same origin as the page itself.)
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors *uri* (The page can only be displayed in a frame on the specified origins.)
