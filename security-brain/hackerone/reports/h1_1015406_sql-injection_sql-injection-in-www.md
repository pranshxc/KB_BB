## Original Report

##Description:
SQL Injection is a vulnerability which allows interference with the queries performed on a database, to obtain sensitive information which could be really useful to attackers. A web application database is often queried using user-requests parameters, which when are not properly sanitized can be modified injecting malicious code.  In this case, the vulnerable endpoint is http://www.████████ and the vulnerable parameter is the POST rnum parameter. Respecting the program guidelines, I performed the minimal amount of testing required to prove that a vulnerability existed, but please tell me if I can bring the exploitation further to give more information.

##Reproduction steps
1 -Repeat the below requests with a interceptor proxy (for example, using Burp).
```
POST ████ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.████
Content-Length: 72
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://www.███████
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.75 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Referer: http://www.███████████
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,it-IT;q=0.8,it;q=0.7
Cookie: PHPSESSID=█████
Connection: close

███████
```
```
POST ██████████ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.███████
Content-Length: 72
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Origin: http://www.█████
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.75 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Referer: http://www.████████████████
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,it-IT;q=0.8,it;q=0.7
Cookie: PHPSESSID=████
Connection: close

█████
```
In the first case, the record obtained from the database is the following:
```
██████
```
██████
Whilst in the second case, the record obtained is:
```
███
```
█████
This confirms that the OFFSET clause is concatenated to the original query and there is the possibility to exploit a SQL Injection.

## Impact

The vulnerability could allow an attacker to dump sensitive and personal data from the web application database (such as usernames and password hashes) or to perform authentication bypasses.
