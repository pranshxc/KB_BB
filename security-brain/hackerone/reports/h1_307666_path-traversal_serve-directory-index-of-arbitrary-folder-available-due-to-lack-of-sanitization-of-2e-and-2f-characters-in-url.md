## Original Report

Hi,

This report is about Arbitrary Directory Listing vulnerability I found in serve module.
Vulnerability does not allow to open arbitrary file due to ```send``` module which handles file reading and implements its own validation and protection against Path Traversal attacks.

However ```serve``` handles directory listing on its own and does not protect against listing of any directory on the remote server.

**Module:** 

```Serve``` is a module which allows to server static files and browse directories in the browser. The vulnerability exists in the latest available version (6.4.8)

Link to npm page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve

**Summary:** 

```Serve``` does not handle ```%2e``` (.) and ```%2f``` (/) and allows to use them in paths, which can be used do go up through directory tree and lists content of any directory.


## Steps To Reproduce:

- install ```serve```

```
$ npm install serve
```

- create simple application which uses ```http-pages``` for serving static files from local server:

```javascript
const serve = require('serve')

const server = serve(__dirname, {
    port: 4444,
    ignore: []
})
```

- run application:

```
$ node app.js
```

- open the browser and go to ```http://localhost:4444``` You should see all directories and files in the directory, where ```app.js``` was run:

{F256095}

- now, open the following url: ```http://localhost:4444/..%2f/..%2f/..%2f/..%2f/etc/``` (please adjust the number of ..%2f/ to reflect your system). You'll be able to see the content of ```/etc``` directory:

{F256096}


## Supporting Material/References:

Configuration I've used to find this vulnerability:

- macOS HighSierra 10.13.2
- node 8.9.3
- npm 5.5.1
- curl 7.54.0

## Wrap up

I hope this report will help to keep Node ecosystem more safe. If you have any questions about any details of this finding, please let me know in comment.

Thank you

## Impact

This vulnerability allows malisious user to list content of any directory on the remote machine, where ```serve``` runs. Although it's not enough to open and read arbitrary files, this still might expose some sensitive information which can be used in different attacks.
