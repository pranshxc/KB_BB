## Original Report

**Description:**
XSS vulnerability found on one of `█████` subdomains. [ DoD scope]

After analyzing `https://███████/` (██████) I found  `path/user/NextRequestAccount.action` page that have `militarybranch` parameter in `GET` request.  `militarybranch` parameter vulnerable to XSS vulnerability.


`https://████/` requires a valid user to access the contents, but the registration page is accessible to all visitors without any restrictions or credentials.
█████████

User should select `Military Branch` in registration page and there is reflection point! 
Modifying `militarybranch` parameter in request and set payload on it, you'll receive `XSS Success!` alert box.


Payload:
`https://█████████/path/user/NextRequestAccount.action?militarybranch=███████%3CHTMl%0Aonmouseover%0A=%0Aalert(%27XSSSuccess!%27)%0Dx//&firstName=0xd3adc0de&middleName=0xd3adc0de&lastName=0xd3adc0de&email=0xd3adc0de&title=0xd3adc0de&department=&organization=&ship=0xd3adc0de&orgid=&location=`
