## Original Report

Hello team, how are you?

I hope you are well.

I am reporting the vulnerability as this is not a generic bug. And since the vulnerability has already been identified, I thought it important to let the Mozilla Team know.
As it says in the scope of the program, if a Mozilla site uses the third party application, the bug could be reported. So in this bug I preferred to report.

# Disclosure of Secrets for a Publicly Accessible Asset

## Overview of the Vulnerability

In the midst of a search, I found a credential of a third-party associated with Mozilla leaked on the internet. This credential gives access to [https://dashboard.smartling.com/](https://dashboard.smartling.com/).
Although the application is an external tool, this application is responsible for managing all translations of the Mozilla website and other *.Mozilla.com applications.
It manages jobs for translations, contains internal Mozilla documents, and has a tool to change any translation performed.
The account associated with this credential has access to some Mozilla projects.
