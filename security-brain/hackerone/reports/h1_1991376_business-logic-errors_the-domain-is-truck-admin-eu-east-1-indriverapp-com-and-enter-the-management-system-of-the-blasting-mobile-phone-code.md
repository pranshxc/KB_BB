## Original Report

## Summary:
Find the mobile phone number of the administrator through the WHOIS information, and then send the verification code. Assuming that the verification code expires for 30 seconds or 1 minute, we can only explode the correct verification code in a short time to log in to the management system, so I choose to blast The verification code between 6000 and 7000, and sends the verification code every time it blasts, knows that the correct verification code is found, and I only exploded 8 times to find the correct verification code

## Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Find the management address through the directory scanning:https://truck-admin.eu-east-1.indriverapp.com/admin/auth
  2. Find the administrator's mobile phone number through WHOIS information:████████
  3. Send the verification code through the mobile phone number, you will receive a four -digit verification code
  4. Enter the four-digit verification code to log in and use Burpsuite to grab the package, blast the verification code and set the range of the verification code to 6000-7000, and the thread is set to 20 to ensure that the correct verification code can be blasting within 30 seconds within 30 seconds
