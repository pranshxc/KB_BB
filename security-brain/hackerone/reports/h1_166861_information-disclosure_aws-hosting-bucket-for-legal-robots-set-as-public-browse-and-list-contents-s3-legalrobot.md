## Original Report

Good day, 

I hope it treats you kindly :)

Legal Robot looks to use AWS hosting for your website.


Description of issue:
=====================

The Amazon Bucket (s3://legalrobot) has been configured to allow Public users access to browse all files on the server.

This is a risk as described as it allows known file paths, file name, and internal content to be indexed by Google and other search engines.
