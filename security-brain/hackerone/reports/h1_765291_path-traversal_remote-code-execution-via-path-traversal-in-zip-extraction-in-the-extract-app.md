# Remote code execution via path traversal in Zip extraction in the Extract app

## Original Report

I realise this doesn't qualify for a reward, as it's a vulnerability in a third-party app, but as the app is part of the "official" VM image provided by Hansson IT, I think it's well worth fixing.

The Extract app doesn't validate the path or filename of a zip file to be extracted, allowing an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files.

How to reproduce
===

Install NextCloud using the VM image with default settings (with the extra security options).

Create a new user with no user group and log in as that user.

Upload the payload zip file (nextcloud-shell.zip, attached) to the root folder (or wherever you like). It contains a modified version of apps/files/App.php, necessary for getting the payload to run.

Click the "Extract here" option for the nextcloud-shell.zip and intercept the request. Modify the **request body** so the request looks something like the following. You need to replace "normaluser" with the username of the user you created in (2):

```

```

Open the following URL (replace host ip with your actual install) and observe how the current user and group are printed: `https://192.168.100.32/apps/files/?dir=/&poc_cmd=whoami`. You can obviously change the poc_cmd parameter to run any command you like.

## Impact

The attacker can run any commands with the privileges of the www-data user. This allows the attacker to access and modify all the files and personally identifiable information in the installation.
