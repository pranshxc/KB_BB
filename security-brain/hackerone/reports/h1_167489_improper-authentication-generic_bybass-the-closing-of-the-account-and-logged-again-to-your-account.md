Hello
### Details:
All My accounts have been closed i dnot know the reason so i have played around and manged to bypass this mechanism using the last unused password token  

### Steps:
-  go to forget password page and get new password reset token and dnot use it 
-  go  and make anything against the rules lead to close your account [ I dnot know what make it close :D]
- go to your email and using the reset password email you will go to the change password page 
- Enter the new password two times you will get in in your profile
- You can edit your privacy and password ,info but when you try to enter your email page the server will respond with 500 internal error 
- if you try to write review the server will respond with 500 internal server error 
- if you try to edit your profile will respond with 500 server error
