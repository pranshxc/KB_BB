## Original Report

Hi Team,

Greetings!

I've come across **jet.acronis.com** of **acronis.com** pointing to an unclaimed Webflow service. Visiting the jet.acronis.com returned the default 404 page for Webflow service, thereby making it potential for subdomain takeover.

**jet.acronis.com** CNAME pointed to **proxy-ssl.webflow.com**. On checking at Webflow Portal using a basic paid plan, the **jet.acronis.com** was discovered to be currently unclaimed/expired and hence allowing anyone to register the same. On completion of the setup process on Amazon using the same sub-domain name, the person shall have full control over the content of the sub-domain of **acronis.com**. The attacker may then host malicious content on the website or may redirect the visitor to another malicious website to spread a malware/virus.


### PoC

- Visit https://jet.acronis.com
- You'll come a page with brand logo (to ensure visibility to the visitors)
- Check sources for the PoC message

### Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create webflow account
2. Upgrade to basic paid option to enable custom domain setup
3. Create a site
4. Go to Project Settings > Hosting
5. Scroll down to custom domains section and add jet.acronis.com to setup

### Additional note

- I've claimed the resource to prevent a bad actor from doing so in the meantime.


### Mitigation

- Claim the custom domain in Webflow portal, after confirmation of releasing the same by myself

## Impact

Sub-domain Takeover may lead to below consequences:

- Phishing / Spear Phishing
- Malware distribution
- XSS
- Authentication bypass and more
- Credential stealing

Sub-domain Takeover may also allow for SSL certificate be generated with ease, since few certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt requires only domain verification.
