## Original Report

Hello!

I would like to report about a new issue based on "@" character in URL. It shows user real URL but when he clicks "Proceed", he is redirected to another website.

For example, it seems as normal HackerOne URL: [https://hackerone.com/bugs?team_id=0&sort_type=latest_activity&sort_direction=descending&state=open&limit=25&page=1&substates%5B%5D=new&substates%5B%5D=triaged&substates%5B%5D=resolved&substates%5B%5D=wont-fix&substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&substates%5B%5D=duplicate&substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&substates%5B%5D=spam&text_query=&report_id=59426](https://hackerone.com ∕ bugs？team_id=0&sort_type=latest_activity&sort_direction=descending&state=open&limit=25&page=1&substates%5B%5D=new&substates%5B%5D=triaged&substates%5B%5D=resolved&substates%5B%5D=wont-fix&substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&substates%5B%5D=duplicate&substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&substates%5B%5D=spam&text_query=&report_id=59426@google.com)

`Markdown: [https://hackerone.com/bugs?team_id=0&sort_type=latest_activity&sort_direction=descending&state=open&limit=25&page=1&substates%5B%5D=new&substates%5B%5D=triaged&substates%5B%5D=resolved&substates%5B%5D=wont-fix&substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&substates%5B%5D=duplicate&substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&substates%5B%5D=spam&text_query=&report_id=59426](https://hackerone.com ∕ bugs？team_id=0&sort_type=latest_activity&sort_direction=descending&state=open&limit=25&page=1&substates%5B%5D=new&substates%5B%5D=triaged&substates%5B%5D=resolved&substates%5B%5D=wont-fix&substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&substates%5B%5D=duplicate&substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&substates%5B%5D=spam&text_query=&report_id=59426@google.com)`

But when You click "Proceed", You are getting redirected to http://google.com/home

Here is shorter variant of this vulnerability: [http://google.com/home](http://google.com ⁄ home@google.lv)
`Markdown: [http://google.com/home](http://google.com ⁄ home@google.lv)`

It is because modern browsers interpret this scheme like this "http://authorization_data@website", so, when You click on URL, they get You redirected to "http://website".

Also, additionally to report #58612, here are new vectors that still allow to reproduce homograph attack:

[http://google.com](http:\\/gоogle.com) `Markdown: [http://google.com](http:\\/gоogle.com)`
[http://google.com](http:/\\/gоogle.com) `Markdown: [http://google.com](http:/\\/gоogle.com)`
[http://google.com](http:gоogle%2Ecom) `Markdown: [http://google.com](http:gоogle%2Ecom)`

Thanks!
