## Original Report

## Summary:
The server does not perform sanitization on user input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands into a query.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Go to https://promo.indrive.com/10ridestogetprize_ru/random
  2. Click "Сгенерировать". A request to https://id.indrive.com/api/ten-drives/custom-winners/ten_drive_kz_second_weeks/number_trips/29/5/phone will be made:

████████
 3. Repeat this request, but change the path to: 
```
/api/ten-drives/custom-winners/ten_drive_kz_second_weeks/number_trips/1/999%20or%201=1--
```
A random entry from the database will be returned:

████
  4. Change the path in a query to:
```
/api/ten-drives/custom-winners/ten_drive_kz_second_weeks/number_trips/1/999%20or%201=2--
```
The response from the server will be empty:

███████

**Both requests in curl format**
```

## Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to inject any SQL statements into a query.
For example, I was able to retrieve the SQL version:
**PostgreSQL 14.8 (Ubuntu 14.8-0ubuntu0.22.04.1)**
