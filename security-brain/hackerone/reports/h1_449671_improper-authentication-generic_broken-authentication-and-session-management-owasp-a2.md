Hello @liberapay,

**Description**:
It seems now if attacker has csrf token & victim cookies then attacker can easily login to victim account without any login details. (No need Of Any Username/Password)

**Theory Proof-Of-Concept**:
- Go to https://liberapay.com/admin.101/edit/username (*any username/Self Account)
- Refresh Current Page & Copy Cookies By Burp Proxy
- Send Cookie Request to Repeater (Burp Proxy)
- Now, Delete Browsers Cookies Data/Logout/Open Private Mode (Logged Out)
- Go to https://liberapay.com/admin.101/edit/username Again with New Private Window Of Chrome 
- Refresh Current Page that says please log in to continue
- Now, Paste That Our Old Cookies & Forward Request
- Bom! You will logged into old account & able to edit username/mail/password or other info.

**Video Proof-Of-Concept**:
