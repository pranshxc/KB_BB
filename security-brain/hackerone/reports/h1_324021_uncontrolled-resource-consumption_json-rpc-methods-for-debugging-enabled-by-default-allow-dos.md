## Original Report

**Summary:** Upon sending the JSON-RPC the `evm_reset` command, the RPC server hung, has gone slow, and is now on block 0.

**Description:** While testing the bounty RPC node, I was sending a variety of available commands I noticed in the source code. After sending the `evm_reset` command, the server hung, began responding slowly, started returning `504 Gateway Time-out`'s, and is now synced to block 0.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Run `curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber", "params": {}, "id":1337}' https://bounty-node.rsk.co` and observe the block number
2. Run `curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"evm_reset", "params": {}, "id":1337}' https://bounty-node.rsk.co`
3. Response should hang

I also tested from multiple locations (VPS and locally) to confirm that this was not just a IP blacklist or connectivity issue on my end.
