any one who have aws s3 cli can write in your bucket because your bucket writable through aws cli
when i try to move and delete any file on your bucket i got this
###MOVED
	root@injector:~# aws s3 mv test.txt s3://rubyci
	move: ./test.txt to s3://rubyci/test.txt 
###DELETED
	root@injector:~# aws s3 rm s3://rubyci/test.txt
	delete: s3://rubyci/test.txt

any one using aws cli can move and delete any file from your bucket
also check the attached picture and feel free to contact if you need any additional info
