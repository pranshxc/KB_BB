## Original Report

**Summary:** 
After downloading putty-0.70-2019-01-17.53747ad.tar.gz, I compiled it on Debian 9 with Clang-8.0.0 and AddressSanitizer and while trying to extract a public key from a crafted key, I triggered a heap-use-after-free in main().

**Description:** [add more details about this vulnerability]

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Compile putty without GTK and with AddressSanitizer.
```
CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS=-fsanitize=address CXXFLAGS=-fsanitize=address ./configure --without-gtk && make --j2
```

2. `./puttygen -L test0025.ppk`

```

## Supporting Material/References:

  * List any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, etc.)

## Impact

1) The use of previously freed memory may corrupt valid data, if the memory area in question has been allocated and used properly elsewhere.  

2) If chunk consolidation occurs after the use of previously freed data, the process may crash when invalid data is used as chunk information. 

3) If malicious data is entered before chunk consolidation can take place, it may be possible to take advantage of a write-what-where primitive to execute arbitrary code.
