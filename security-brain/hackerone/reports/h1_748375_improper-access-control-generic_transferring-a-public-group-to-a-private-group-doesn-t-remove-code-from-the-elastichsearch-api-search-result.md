## Original Report

### Summary

When a public group with public projects is transferred to a private group, the code and the wiki of the public project, although now should be private, it is still reachable through search APIs.

I set the severity as "medium" and not "high", because any new action over the project issues a re indexing (or some actions, not sure), so if the transfer is for "archiving" purposes it is a problem, but if after the transfer other activities happen, then it is not a problem, cause the project will be removed from the index.

### Steps to reproduce

Alice creates the public group "Example", and a public project named "Example-project" inside the group. In the readme of the project, Alice writes "Example".

Now, Alice creates a private group called "private", and transfer all the "Example" group to the "private" group.

If Bob (totally unrelated to Alice), search for "Example" instance-wide, will not find anything on the interface, but the count of the results will be "1" (see screenshot).

If he uses the APIs (e.g. http://localhost/api/v4/search?search=password&scope=blobs), he will receive the results back with the information that should be private.

This happens also with wiki_blobs.

This doesn't happen transferring single projects, but only transferring entire groups

## Impact

Alice thinks her code is now private, but it is not, unless she continues working on the project
