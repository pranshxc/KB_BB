## Original Report

It is possible to enhance videos with paid tracks without buying the track.

Steps to verify:
1. Log into vimeo.com and navigate to https://vimeo.com/enhancer.
2. Click on any paid music track and note down the track id from the URL (ex: https://vimeo.com/musicstore/track/110272/talaky-instrumental-by-gayle-cloud : Track id is: 110272, cost: $1.99). 
3. Back to the enhancer. Choose a free track (say, girl with a motory cycle track, id: 84469) and click on the video symbol to enhance video with this track.
4. Choose the video to enhance. Click on Enhance button and intercept this request using burp proxy. Intercepted request looks like,

    POST /enhancer HTTP/1.1
    Host: vimeo.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
    [...]

    action=save&token=...&clip_id=118026546&track_id=84469&job_data=....

5. Replace the track id in the above request with paid track value (say, 110272). Modified request looks like, 

    POST /enhancer HTTP/1.1
    Host: vimeo.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
    [...]

    action=save&token=..&clip_id=118026546&track_id=110272&job_data=...

6. Send the modified request to the server. It creates the enhanced video with paid track without buying it.
