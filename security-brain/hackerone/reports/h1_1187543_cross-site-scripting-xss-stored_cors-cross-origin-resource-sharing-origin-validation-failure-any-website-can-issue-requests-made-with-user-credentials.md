==In this report I want to describe a high-level bug that can seriously put a user account at risk.==


>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin requests. This application is using CORS in an insecure way.

>The web application fails to properly validate the Origin header (check Details section for more information) and returns the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true.

>In this configuration any website can issue requests made with user credentials and read the responses to these requests. Trusting arbitrary origins effectively disables the same-origin policy, allowing two-way interaction by third-party web sites.
