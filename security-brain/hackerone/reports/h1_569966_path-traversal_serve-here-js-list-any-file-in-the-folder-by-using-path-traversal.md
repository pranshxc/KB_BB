## Original Report

I would like to report Path Traversal in **serve-here.js**. It allows to list any file in another folder of web root.

# Module

**module name:** serve-here.js
**version:** 1.1.3
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-here.js`

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

serve-here.js is simply get the path name of url and add it to the web root. it means if you input ../, it will happy add it to web root and you can list the folder you choose. But the trick is web browser or curl are also to try rebuild the url containing ../. I used the burp to make a raw url and send it to server.

## Steps To Reproduce:

install `serve-here.js`
`$ npm install serve-here.js -g`

start program
`$ serve-here

start burpsuite and enter the url contain ../. you should see the files in the folder.
