## Original Report

**Summary:** This bug affects suuport.ratelimited.me and can be used by attackers to download local file from your servers including your emails, and files uploaded by your admins and other users.

**Description:** While starting a conversation with your support agent, I noticed an option to upload a file. And after it was being uploaded it was included with a "blob_id" parameter. it is vulnerable and is leading to download of all the files on your support server.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  * Follow the above steps as mentioned in description to get to the request mentioned below.]

```
GET /chat/send-attach/583-5PH467W8RA2NCWJ?__sid=583-5PH467W8RA2NCWJ&send_blob_id=485&_=1525115609706 HTTP/1.1

```

  * After this I used a simple Intruder in the Burp suite to automate my requests to find out which blob_id numbers are giving a 200 Response. Attached a screenshot of the same.

  * I was able to read your personal emails and all the server logs, also all the files uploaded by others and admins. I was also able to join a ticket due to an email which leaked the joining link.
The irony is I was also able to read the email sent by Hackerone support to start this program :D

No harm has been done, you can remove the screenshots from here after you fix this bug.

## Supporting Material/References:

  * Have attached all the screenshots below which shows how harmful this could have been.
