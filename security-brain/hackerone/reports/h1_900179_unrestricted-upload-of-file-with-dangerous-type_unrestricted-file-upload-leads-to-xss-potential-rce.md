## Original Report

**Summary:**
Unrestricted file upload at████████/request?openform. When the user wants to upload a file the app allows the user to upload a HTML file leading to stored XSS and creation of a simple php script. A user can upload the HTML file and trigger XSS and trigger potential RCE with php shell. Please go to the ██████ Request that I created at -- ██████████AllOpenOrders/4F4D0C69EA2B33A58525858A001E2B8C?opendocument and select the file at the bottom "unsure1.html" to trigger payload to show XSS and php shell. You can also go directly to the uploaded file at ████0/4f4d0c69ea2b33a58525858a001e2b8c/$FILE/unsure1.html. Please see the attached PoC video as well. Thanks.
