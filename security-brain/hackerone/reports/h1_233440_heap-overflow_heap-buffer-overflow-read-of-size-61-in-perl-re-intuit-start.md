SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow ??:0 __interceptor_memcmp
```

##What is happening?##
```
When a match is anchored against the start of a string, the regexp can be compiled to include a fixed string match against a fixed offset in the string. In some cases, where the matched against string included UTF-8 before the fixed offset, this could result in attempting a memcmp() which overlaps the end of the string and potentially past the end of the allocated memory.
```

##Arguments for:##
On [29 August 2016](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Attachment/1420527/768174/), Tony says `It *might* be possible to use this as a hard to trigger denial of service attack, eg. if the memcmp() went past the end of a page into unmapped memory.`

On the same day in [another comment](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Attachment/1420627/768230/), Tony says `An attacker that can control the regexp *might* be able to use that to examine the contents of memory beyond the terminating NUL, which would be critical if that previously held a password or anything else sensitive.`

##Arguments Against:##
On [6 September 2016](https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Attachment/1422020/769144/), Dave says `I don't think this is a security issue any more, and I think your patch should be applied.`

##Fix##
Patch was released on 30 October 2016 and it was released today, 30 May 2017, with Perl 5.26.0. (Worth noting that 52 of the bug fixes in Perl 5.26.0 were from my reports).
