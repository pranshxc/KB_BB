## Original Report

Summary:

Cross Origin Resource Sharing Misconfiguration | Lead to sensitive information.
Description:

An HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy controls whether and how content running on other domains can perform two-way interaction with the domain that publishes the policy. The policy is fine-grained and can apply access controls per-request based on the URL and other features of the request.
Trusting arbitrary origins effectively disables the same-origin policy, allowing two-way interaction by third-party web sites. Unless the response consists only of unprotected public content, this policy is likely to present a security risk.
If the site specifies the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, third-party sites may be able to carry out privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information. Even if it does not, attackers may be able to bypass any IP-based access controls by proxying through users' browsers.

Platform(s) Affected: [website]

*.nordvpncom
Steps To Reproduce:
Proof Of Concept 1:
When you get login ucp.nordvpn.com then check burpsuite httphistory there you get this api endpoint.
Request:

How to fix:

Rather than using a wildcard or programmatically verifying supplied origins, use a whitelist of trusted domains.

## Impact

Attacker would treat many victims to visit attacker's website, if victim is logged in, then his personal information is recorded in attacker's server.

If the site specifies the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, third-party sites may be able to carry out privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information. Even if it does not, attackers may be able to bypass any IP-based access controls by proxying through users' browsers.
