## Original Report

Hi there,

As there is rate limit in the website, but it doesn't prevent users to take more than 1 trial which later leads to loss of the company, because by getting more trials I can get more strings and languages limit.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Create an account on https://hosted.weblate.org and setup burp suite with your browser.
2) Now, click on add project from the top + icon > select add a new translation project.
3) Turn on the intercept and click on Gratis trial for commercial hosting >  Start Trial
4) Capture the request and send it to Turbo intruder.
5) Add "Test: %s" header in the request and select race.py config.
6) Start attack, you will get 6 trials. As projects are free and unlimited but you can get more strings limit. In one trial you get 50,000 strings limit, but with 6 trials you get 50,000 x 6 strings limit and more than 100 languages.
