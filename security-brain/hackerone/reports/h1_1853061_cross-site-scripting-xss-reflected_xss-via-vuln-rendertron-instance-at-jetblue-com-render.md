## Original Report

## Summary

I found that you have █████████ installed on your server, but it may not be up to date. i was able to get around ███'s xss block and get it to raise an alert. this is a type of xss that is mirrored and as soon as you send a link to a person, the xss runs. and in a malicious scenario, it would be very compatible. why?

because it takes the code from the uploaded page and runs it as a response on the server.

Now you may say this is normal for a render page.
But unfortunately, it is not normal for an xss code to work, and it works in a subdomain with your domain.
