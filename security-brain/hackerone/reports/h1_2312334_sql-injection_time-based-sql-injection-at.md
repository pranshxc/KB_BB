## POC

Make the following POST request to /pubs/index.php

```
POST /pubs/index.php HTTP/1.1
Host:██████
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:121.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/121.0

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1

Notice that the response time will be 25 seconds.

This can be further exploited manually or using automated tools such as SQLmap to get data from the DB, but I will stop here for this report.

Thanks.
