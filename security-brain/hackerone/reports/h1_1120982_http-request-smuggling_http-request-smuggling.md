## Original Report

hello dear support 
I have found HTTP Request Smuggling on www.████████

Issue description
==============

HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities arise when websites route HTTP requests through webservers with inconsistent HTTP parsing.
By supplying a request that gets interpreted as being different lengths by different servers, an attacker can poison the back-end TCP/TLS socket and prepend arbitrary data to the next request. Depending on the website's functionality, this can be used to bypass front-end security rules, access internal systems, poison web caches, and launch assorted attacks on users who are actively browsing the site.

## Impact

Impact
an attacker can poison the TCP / TLS socket and add arbitrary data to the next request. Depending on the functionality of the website, this can be used to bypass front-end security rules, internal system access, poison the web cache, and launch various attacks on users who actively activate the site.
