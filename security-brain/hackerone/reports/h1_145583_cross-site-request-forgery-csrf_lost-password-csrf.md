## Original Report

Hi,

I think it is something about your Wordpress version.It's not something highy risky bu it is vulnerability.

CODE:

<form name="lostpasswordform" id="lostpasswordform" action="https://nextcloud.com/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword" method="post" style="position: static; left: 0px;">
	<p>
		<label for="user_login">Username or Email<br>
		<input type="text" name="user_login" id="user_login" class="input" value="" size="20"></label>
	</p>
		<input type="hidden" name="redirect_to" value="">
	<p class="submit"><input type="submit" name="wp-submit" id="wp-submit" class="button button-primary button-large" value="Get New Password"></p>
</form>



For testing CSRF  I added the .html file to attachments.And there is a screenshot for you.


How To Fix :

Adding rp_key will be fine.
