## Original Report

Hi All,
I believe I've found a vulnerability with regards to creating, editing and deleting favorite prescriptions.

##Description
I have a doctor's organization with a staff member who has no permissions. If I visit ```https://1337test.drchrono.com/erx/``` I get permission denied. However, I can create, edit and delete favorites by making the appropriate POST call:

##Steps to reproduce
1. Create a doctors organization
2. Create a staff member with no permissions
3. Logout and log in as the staff member with no permissions
4. Replicated the calls above substituting your cookies, CSRF, etc.

##Vulnerability
This is another permission by pass. However, the most severe potential I see here is the ability for an attacker to modify a favorite which a doctor doesn't realize and then uses to prescribe to a patient.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Pete
