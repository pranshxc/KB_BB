Nextcloud has it leaked publicly through an open endpoint on their website... Which goes against the Proprietary Information part of the document as it's NCC property.

Steps to reproduce:

1.  Open Browser of choice (Firefox was used)
2. Open google search

4. Click on the 3 page of results and you should see a title [PDF]NCC Group Nextcloud 11 – Security Review
5. Proceed to click on it ( https://nextcloud.com/wp-content/themes/next/assets/files/NCC_report_full.pdf )

You can see in the document the information above.

## Impact

There are sensitive documents that are open to the public which breaks NCC's  𝘗𝘳𝘰𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘺 𝘐𝘯𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘮𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 agreement stated on the document. This could lead to legal trouble for Nextcloud with NCC.
