## Original Report

I would like to report "A simple remote code execution" in "pdf-image".
It allows "a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code when several functions of the PDFImage class are called and the class loaded from user-input value".

# Module

**module name:** pdf-image
**version:** latest
**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-image`

## Module Description

Provides an interface to convert PDF's pages to png files in Node.js by using ImageMagick.

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

Hello there ! I understand this bug isn't eligible for a bounty. I am reporting it either way. I've found several code execution in the pdf-image class, I tested one of them. They are simple and of course come from the child_process.exec call with lack of escaping. I tested one of them.

## Steps To Reproduce:

var PDFImage = require("pdf-image").PDFImage;

var pdfImage = new PDFImage('"; sleep 500 #"');
pdfImage.getInfo();

You can also exploit the vulnerability by submitting  backticks (example payload: `ls;sleep 5` which will be executed even though you're double-quoting the input.

## Patch
You can take example on your command-exists npm class:
var isUsingWindows = process.platform == 'win32'
var cleanInput = function(s) {
  if (/[^A-Za-z0-9_\/:=-]/.test(s)) {
    s = "'"+s.replace(/'/g,"'\\''")+"'";
    s = s.replace(/^(?:'')+/g, '') // unduplicate single-quote at the beginning
      .replace(/\\'''/g, "\\'" ); // remove non-escaped single-quote if there are enclosed between 2 escaped
  }
  return s;
}

if (isUsingWindows) {
  cleanInput = function(s) {
    var isPathName = /[\\]/.test(s);
    if (isPathName) {
      var dirname = '"' + path.dirname(s) + '"';
      var basename = '"' + path.basename(s) + '"';
      return dirname + ':' + basename;
    }
    return '"' + s + '"';
  }
}

## Impact

Bad code relying on that class can feel foul to RCE.
