## Original Report

**If you click the link https://███, you're redirected to https://██████/users/sign_in, where credentials have to be inserted. 
The repositories are private and shouldn't be accessable for unauthenticated users!**

### POC

* If you click the following links https://████/api/v4/projects, information about internal projects and users is leaked

* I just take projectid: 4667 as an example for the information disclosure
```
