## Original Report

## Summary
Hello dear team,
I found a serious issue in Acronis
This vulnerability is called ticket trick vulnerability which comes under critical category. Which can allow me to login on websites like atlassian,github,clouflare,choopa,..etc on behalf of support_mobility@acronis.com .

## Steps To Reproduce
Lets take an example to get your github account.

1. As Github send account register verification mails from noreply@github.com
2. I registered an account on acronis with same email.
3. Now your support system creates ticket of emails sent to  support_mobility@acronis.com .
4. So I registered an account  on github and logged into my acronis account with email noreply@github.com .
5. As Acronis allowed me to see support tickets without email verification , so I was able to see support tickets easily created by noreply@acronis.com .
6. On support ticket there was an email verification link sent to noreply@github.com .
7. In this way I was able to takeover many account registered with  support_mobility@acronis.com and many internal accounts that can be accessed with only @acronis.com

##POC

I was able to register a github account on your email address :-
