## Original Report

I have found and reported an out of bounds memory read in PHP [exif_process_user_comment]
When PHP EXIF extension is parsing EXIF information from an image, e.g. via exif_read_data() function, in PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.31, 7.2.x below 7.2.21 and 7.3.x below 7.3.8 it is possible to supply it with data what will cause it to read past the allocated buffer.
