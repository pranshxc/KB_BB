## Original Report

Actuall this report is same as of this one:- https://hackerone.com/reports/38007  


Subdomain takeover vulnerabilities occur when a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) is pointing to a service (e.g. GitHub pages, Heroku, etc.) that has been removed or deleted. This allows an attacker to set up a page on the service that was being used and point their page to that subdomain. For example, if subdomain.example.com was pointing to a GitHub page and the user decided to delete their GitHub page, an attacker can now create a GitHub page, add a CNAME file containing subdomain.example.com, and claim subdomain.example.com.

Here there is a greenhouse domain  (demo.greenhouse.io) which is pointing towards unbounce pages so  this domain can be taken over can can be used to do any type of attacks mostly i can make a fake login page on your behalf and spoof your users, this is a critical vulnerability and needs to be fixed .
