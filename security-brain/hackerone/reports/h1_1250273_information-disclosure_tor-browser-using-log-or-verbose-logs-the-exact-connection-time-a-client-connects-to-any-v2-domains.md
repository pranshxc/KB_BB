# Tor Browser using --log or --verbose logs the exact connection time a client connects to any v2 domains.

## Original Report

## Summary:
A vulnerability in the Tor Browser 78.11.0esr and below allows a local or physical attacker to view metadata about v2 domains, namely the exact timestamp that a user connected to a v2 onion address while using either the --log or --verbose command line options. A local or physical attacker can identify the exact moment a user connected to a new v2 onion site, easily triangulating the user via a complete log of connection timestamps in the log file, or verbosely in the terminal window. This timestamp is generated every single time a client connects to a v2 onion address and could therefore be easily compared with a server connection log, a compromised Tor end point, or other related Tor attack, affecting the confidentiality & integrity of a user's Tor session when using --log or --verbose.

## Steps To Reproduce:
Download Tor latest
Use either:
`./start-tor-browser.desktop --log ./file.log`
`./start-tor-browser.desktop --verbose`

Visit http://wikitoronionlinks.com/

Click on an assortment of .onion v2 URLs.

Inspect the output.

Notably, the warning occurs when the client connects, rather than clicking a link, making it even easier to pair up with server connection times.
