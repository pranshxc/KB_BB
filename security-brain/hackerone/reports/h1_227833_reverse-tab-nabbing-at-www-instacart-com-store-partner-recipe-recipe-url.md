### FIX & MITIGATION

To  mitigate this issue we need to use rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" as follows:

```<a target="_blank" class="btn external-url" href="https://evil.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>
</a>```

Now when you click on this link, the attacker cannot access the initial tab.
