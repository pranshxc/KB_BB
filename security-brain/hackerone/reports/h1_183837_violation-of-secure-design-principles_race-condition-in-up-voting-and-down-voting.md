## Original Report

Hi,

I want to report an issue that I have found on http://www.urbandictionary.com/
when a user wants to up vote or down vote a term he simply presses on the up or down button.
each user can up vote or down vote a term only once, but I have found that if a parallel threads do the process of up voting then multiple requests will be accepted.

**POC**

I entered the following term url: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=alicia
intercepted the request using burp suite and sent it to intruder and set the number of threads to be 11 then started the requests which has the following:

GET /v0/vote?defid=3889203&direction=up&key=ab71d33b15d36506acf1e379b0ed07ee HTTP/1.1

which means I can up vote more than once and of course the same applies for down voting which can mislead users and creates fake reputation for the terms created.

thanks.
