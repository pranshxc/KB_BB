## Original Report

# Description
I found a Persistent XSS in a listing page. The flaw is in the SoundCloud link that the listing owner can attach(The parameter is called *product[soundcloud_link_attributes][link]*). There's no encoding on the user input and it looks like there's only client-side validation.

# PoC
The payload:
```
https://soundcloud.com/rich-the-kid/sets/the-world-is-yours-15?fuzzing" onload=alert(document.domain) x="
```
If you try to put this payload straight into the "Edit Listing" page it'll give you the following error:
```
https://sandbox.reverb.com/listings/[YOUR_LISTING_ID]/edit
```
{F281627}

But it looks like there's only client side validation, when I tried to enter a valid link:
```
https://soundcloud.com/rich-the-kid/sets/the-world-is-yours-15
```
I got no error message(because it was a valid link)
But when I clicked "Save & Review Listing", intercepted the request and tampered the *product[soundcloud_link_attributes][link]* parameter's value to:
```
https://soundcloud.com/rich-the-kid/sets/the-world-is-yours-15?fuzzing" onload=alert(document.domain) x="
```
It updated successfully and because there's no encoding on this input parameter - it allowed me to inject javascript code that'll be stored on my listing page.
