## Original Report

## Summary:
* [ Leaking very sensitive information through a JS file that is clearly for developers within the website and should not be available to the public.

* The leaked information consists of a lot of API keys, Paypal keys, information and keys about the server and the application, and a lot or a lot of sensitive information, and I will explain the information through screenshots. ]

* I will explain and clarify each of these keys that were leaked. I will explain the function of the key, what is its importance, is it considered confidential information or not, and what is the potential impact that would occur if this key was leaked by attackers?, I will try to provide solutions as well .

* Given the functions of these keys and what might happen if they are exploited, I will content myself with providing a detailed breakdown in writing, because if I attempt to exploit them, I strongly believe that severe damage will occur if the exploitation is successful.

## Warning: Please read these details carefully and verify them with one of Reddit’s developers and verify them very carefully because the functions of these keys, their confidentiality, and preserving them from leaking are extremely important for the security of the application and the users.

## POC:
* 1- stripe:{apiKey:e=>{return e||!Object(n.b)()&&!Object(n.c)()?"pk_test_Me5fd06PSuMkMF5YnwuMfFf4":"pk_live_sD8LeDtVnlJwAGf51jLygWpH"
The stripe key, specifically the apiKey within the stripe object, is used for integration with the payment processing service called Stripe on the Reddit website. Stripe offers tools and APIs that allow websites to accept payments securely over the internet.
This apiKey is crucial as it enables Reddit's systems to authenticate and interact securely with Stripe's services. It determines which mode (test or live) Reddit uses to process payment transactions.
Regarding sensitivity, the apiKey itself is considered sensitive information. If this key were to be leaked or compromised by attackers, it could lead to potential unauthorized access to Reddit's payment processing systems via Stripe. This might result in fraudulent transactions, manipulation of payment settings, or even theft of financial information related to transactions made on Reddit.
Moreover, leaking the apiKey might allow attackers to bypass Reddit's controls over payment processing, enabling them to initiate transactions or manipulate payment-related functionalities on the platform. This could impact the financial integrity of Reddit and erode user trust in the security of payment transactions on the site.
In summary, the stripe apiKey is a critical component for Reddit's payment processing through Stripe. Its security is paramount to prevent unauthorized access, fraudulent transactions, and protect sensitive financial data.


* 2- PAYPAL_API_KEY||(Object(n.b)()||Object(n.c)()?"AXHUGZNCrshqynIpOLkQjqlsrA26Knvf4EB5w1RKfsdxKdsA5WSNo9H_Gng6plKyc48qGhXtmwcYahRy":"AXH6yPVeFV8sxT1zMvzr8NyPMXx_YkYui1XCy3btQ_s1Zz2R68JC57PqQ2mrj6la-G8y-7UmZyKVsDaR")

To commit fraud: Attackers could use the key to change payment information, such as the credit card number or expiration date. This could be used to commit fraud or to steal money from users.
To disrupt business: Attackers could use the key to cancel payments that have already been processed. This could be used to disrupt business or to steal money from businesses.
By understanding the potential risks of leaking the PAYPAL_API_KEY key, reddit.com can take steps to protect itself and its users from attacks.
In the specific case of the key you provided, the impact would be limited because it is a test key. However, it is still important to keep this key secure to prevent it from being used for malicious purposes.


* 3- BRAINTREE_PAYPAL_KEY||(Object(n.b)()?"Aflf49iitQXbetXO8Ufm6q7zjADO-15_X1tzZqv-hveq4htWjHYNxEmrtB0s0yyyLOCG_ceCB-32EtdY":"AXH6yPVeFV8sxT1zMvzr8NyPMXx_YkYui1XCy3btQ_s1Zz2R68JC57PqQ2mrj6la-G8y-7UmZyKVsDaR"),env
The BRAINTREE_PAYPAL_KEY is a key used for integrating Braintree's PayPal services into the Reddit website, specifically for handling and facilitating PayPal transactions.
This key plays a crucial role in allowing Reddit's systems to securely communicate and authenticate with Braintree's PayPal API. It enables the platform to process payments, manage transactions, and facilitate financial interactions between Reddit and Braintree's PayPal infrastructure.
Regarding its sensitivity, the BRAINTREE_PAYPAL_KEY is considered confidential information. If this key were to be leaked or compromised by attackers, it could pose significant security risks and potential financial threats. Attackers might exploit the key to gain unauthorized access to Reddit's Braintree integration, potentially performing unauthorized transactions, altering payment configurations, or accessing sensitive financial data associated with PayPal transactions conducted through Reddit.
Additionally, a leaked BRAINTREE_PAYPAL_KEY might allow attackers to misuse Braintree's PayPal services on behalf of Reddit without proper authorization. This could lead to financial losses, misuse of resources, or disruptions in the payment processing system, impacting both Reddit and its users.
Overall, the BRAINTREE_PAYPAL_KEY is a critical component for enabling PayPal's functionalities via Braintree on Reddit. Its security is vital in preventing unauthorized access, financial fraud, and ensuring the integrity of payment transactions and financial data on the platform.


* 4- PAYPAL_API_KEY||Object(n.b)()||Object(n.c)()?"production":"sandbox",buttons:{premium:"LAYT3KA5EVVTJ",coins500:"SNCZX9LADYMT4",coins1100:"6P6X4LTAKNDGG",coins1800:"2P5FZYZL42NME",coins7200:"W8BKWZXBSWZGC",coins40000:"Y9LZ5M2W6VT3A",coinsGild500:"BPVKB5BY8HXRA",coinsGild1100:"TPGZ3HZ3KE5TS",coinsGild1800:"YXZDTMAGNMMEA",coinsGild7200:"MQDLLC4FBNSZG",coinsGild40000:"T3RL7U6STH7WL"
The PAYPAL_API_KEY you're referring to seems to be a part of the configuration or settings related to PayPal integration within Reddit. However, the format provided appears to have a conditional structure involving Object(n.b)() and Object(n.c)() that seems incomplete, possibly indicating a conditional check or logic associated with the PayPal API key for distinguishing between production and sandbox environments.
In general, the function of a PayPal API key in any online platform, including Reddit, is to authenticate and authorize access to PayPal's services. This key is used to establish a secure connection between Reddit's systems and PayPal's API (Application Programming Interface). It allows Reddit to initiate and manage payment transactions, process financial operations, and interact with PayPal's infrastructure securely.
As for sensitivity, API keys like the PAYPAL_API_KEY are indeed considered sensitive information. If this key were to be exposed or leaked, especially in a scenario where it distinguishes between production (live/real) and sandbox (testing) environments, it could pose several risks:
Unauthorized Transactions: Attackers could potentially use the exposed key to perform unauthorized transactions, manipulate payment configurations, or access sensitive financial data associated with PayPal transactions conducted through Reddit.
Misuse of Sandbox Environment: If the key determines whether Reddit operates in a sandbox environment for testing purposes, unauthorized access might lead to the abuse of testing resources or functionalities, potentially disrupting development or testing processes.
Financial Risks: Leaking sensitive payment-related keys could result in financial losses, fraudulent activities, or disruptions in the payment processing system, affecting both Reddit and its users.
Regarding the provided keys such as buttons, these seem to represent specific identifiers or labels associated with different payment options or packages (e.g., premium subscriptions, various coin packages) within Reddit's payment system. These keys likely serve as references or identifiers for specific payment options presented to users during transactions.
Overall, while the specific context of the conditional statement isn’t entirely clear, the PAYPAL_API_KEY and associated payment identifiers are crucial for Reddit's PayPal integration, and their security is essential to safeguard against unauthorized access, financial fraud, and maintain the integrity of payment transactions within the platform.


* 5- giphyApiKey:"k2kwyMA6VeyHM6ZRT96OXDGaersnx73Z"
The giphyApiKey key is used to authenticate requests to the Giphy API. This API is used by reddit.com to fetch GIFs and other animated images.
