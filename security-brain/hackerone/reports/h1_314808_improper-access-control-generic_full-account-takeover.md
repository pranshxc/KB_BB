## Original Report

Hello Team,

I got a security issue in reverb ios application which allows an attacker hack all users account.
Since iOS application is not in the scope but still I am reporting this, because this vulnerability may compromise all users account.
Please resolve this quickly. 

Desription:
Reverb ios application is not validating facebook `access_token` on the server side in login api, which allows an  attacker to hack all account using his own app access token.

Vulnerable request:
```
POST /api/auth/facebook HTTP/1.1
Host: reverb.com

{"fb_token":"EAAJ8Of8DF2IBAL5wChKjuRHSV2VEWpm7eCz2IMqqJy1lJJq8ooyQuKHcOXn6aZCZAIrCtClbrZBdUGhC3FbvncNYk1E0k7AOktEhDjUPwHPOh3x29JURSGIGPBlZCj5WlBHhHzI5KYAPbuXKiZBGTkKZABZATh9JjTqEDhRubYSEiTmhjeytx5moFH9naZB6XjZBRUMkmcbucFD9Vf8IoFZAD1LGngi6j5pXFGcTFPfBEudAZDZD"}
```
Here in vulnerable i used lyst app access token to login.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Replay vulnerable request in vulnerable request in burp suite
2. Use any other app access token .
