## Original Report

Hi security ,

Description:
I found user id in encrypted form from there profile url 
https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=<user id's>

on intercepting request of add friend, complement and send message i can identify user id ..
when i change identified user ID to other user's ID then request of add friend is send to other user without any token and secession validation .. scenario for the complement and send message is same.

Impact:
->an attacker can add the authenticated user to his account or any others accounts ..
->can send message to any one by user's account 
->can complement on other users by victim user
