# RCE via File Upload  with a Null Byte Truncated File Extension at https://██████/

## Original Report

Hi,

I found "repos" at `https://███/` and `https://c█████████/` and this one (which doesn't have the file upload functionality appearing on the DOM, but it still may be there) `https://███████`.  There may be more, I had to fuzz a lot to find these. 

These repos contain file upload functionality. I found that if you place a null byte between file extensions, you can upload files with malicious extensions. 

Running the `dir` command at the uploaded file `https://████████/savefiles/poc.asp?cmd=dir`  - the shell has been deleted for security purposes. Let me know if you want me to reupload it. 

██████████

The request from burp - note the null byte: 

█████



*** Reproduction ***

1. Navigate to `https://███/`

2. Submit a file upload the same as the request I made above. Make sure there is a null byte between asp and png. 

3. Visit `https://████████/savefiles/poc.asp` and run commands. 


## Impact

Everything could be compromised.

## Steps to Reproduce
Here is the actual request, but I'm not sure how well the null byte will translate.
