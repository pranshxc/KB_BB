# Possible DOS in app with crashing `exceptions_app`

## Metadata

- HackerOne Report ID: 1300802
- Weakness: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
- Program: rails
- Disclosed At: 2023-06-28T00:42:04.824Z
- Has Bounty: No
- Visibility: full
- Substate: resolved

## Original Report

Make a new Rails app, add the `lograge` gem.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.exceptions_app = self.routes
config.lograge.enabled = true
```

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root to: "site#index"

  get 'errors/not_found'
  match "/404", to: "errors#not_found", via: :all
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/errors_controller.rb

class ErrorsController < ApplicationController
  def not_found
    render status: 404 # the view can do whatever, it doesn't matter
  end
end
```

Start the server as a production app (eg. it would start on Heroku): `RAILS_ENV=production RACK_ENV=production SECRET_KEY_BASE=foo RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=enabled RAILS_MAX_THREADS=2 RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=enabled rails s`

Run this script:

```ruby
1000.times.each do |n|
  `curl -H "Accept: application/xml" -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -X GET http://localhost:3000///wp1/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml`
end
```

At some point (after 989 requests for me), Puma will crash:

```
2021-08-11 13:23:04 -0500 Rack app ("GET ///wp1/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml" - (127.0.0.1)): #<fatal: machine stack overflow in critical region>
```

Since it's a fatal Ruby error (which is unrecoverable) this leaves Puma in a zombie state, similar to https://github.com/puma/puma/issues/2552

The reason this crashes is:

- [ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/show_exceptions.rb#L55) returns a non-frozen const.
- [lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge/blob/master/lib/lograge/rails_ext/rack/logger.rb#L15) doesn't wrap this response in a `Rack::BodyProxy`. If you weren't using lograge, then Rails would do so [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/railties/lib/rails/rack/logger.rb#L37). Before realising this could be a Rails security vulnerability, I made a PR for this here: https://github.com/roidrage/lograge/pull/333
- [RequestStore](https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store/blob/master/lib/request_store/middleware.rb#L21) mutates the response body. This causes the const in Rails to get mutated, it now is a `Rack::BodyProxy` with a reference to itself. Every time it gets returned, it gets mutated again and the object gets one layer bigger.  Before realising this could be a Rails security vulnerability, I made a PR for the mutation here: https://github.com/steveklabnik/request_store/pull/78
- Eventually, we have an extremely large `Rack::BodyProxy` that references itself hundreds of times in memory. This is easy to make crash. In our case, [Rack::Sendfile](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/sendfile.rb#L113) causes a `SystemStackError`, I think this happens because of how `BodyProxy` handles `respond_to_missing?`.

I don't think this issue is unique to `lograge` + `RequestStore`. It can happen anywhere you have:

- A middleware that mutates a response, and
- `FAILSAFE_RESPONSE` (or another non-frozen const) being passed to that middleware, and
- Something higher in the middleware stack that calls a missing method on the response.

I was about to make a PR to Rails with this patch when it dawned on me that this could be a security issue:

## Impact

If you find an app that's configured as above you could bring it offline by making the same bad request enough times.
