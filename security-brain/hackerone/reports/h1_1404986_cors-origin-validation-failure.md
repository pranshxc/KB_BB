## Original Report

Hi team,

I hope you are doing well on the other side.

## Summary:

I found that ```https://hackers.upchieve.org/``` is using cross-origin resource sharing in an insecure way. The web application fails to properly validate the Origin header and returns the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. This means that any website can issue requests with **user credentials** and read the response.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1- intercept the request to any path in the vulnerable asset.
2- modify the origin header as such:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Origin: https://hackers.upchieve.org.evil.com
Cookie: connect.sid=s%3AjSy6_1N-Y3zG4zqifYrsos2idZrkZePH.%2BjgtEn3a1wuxhiDk86FMXfhg0bPYfJ2jGxytqmA%2BU7Q
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Host: hackers.upchieve.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/83.0.4103.61 Safari/537.36
Connection: Keep-alive
```
3- you can see that our input is reflected in this header and also with credentials being true:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://hackers.upchieve.org.evil.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 19 Nov 2021 07:09:54 GMT

Note: we could bypass filtering with this method -> prefix origins are accepted (www.example.com trusts example.com.evil.com).

## Impact

I tried to sign up for an account, but it seems that the process is complicated, and I also don't live in the US. I'm sure that after signing in, I can exploit the misconfiguration and obtain session cookies to takeover the account. Furthermore, I have tried on every possible unauthenticated path I can get to, and they are all vulnerable.

Kind regards,
