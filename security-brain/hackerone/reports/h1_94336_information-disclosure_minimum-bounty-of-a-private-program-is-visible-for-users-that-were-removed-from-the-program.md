## Original Report

Hello,

Privileged information is getting leaked to an unauthorized user in the json response of `https://hackerone.com/reports/<report id>.json`.

In a team there can be many members, also roles are defined. But an x-member of the team is getting information which should not be visible to him. (As I tested it on sandboxed team but it i believe it is also affecting other private programs )

Proof Of Concept :
================
1. UserA is part of TeamA.
2. UserA creates a test report.
3. Now, UserA can access the report via `Reports` tab.
4. Admin now removes the UserA from the team.
5. Now, UserA becomes X-user of the team.
6. UserA canNOT access the team.
7. But can access the test report which he/she created.

When UserA accesses the report then a request is made to `https://hackerone.com/reports/<report id>.json`. Note the response for my test report.

``
{id: 94333, url: "https://hackerone.com/reports/94333", title: "asdf", state: "Open", substate: "new",…}
abilities: {can_manage?: false, can_export?: false, can_add_comment?: true, can_change_state?: false,…}
activities: []
bug_reporter_agreed_on_going_public_at: null
can_view_team: true
created_at: "2015-10-17T04:29:44.364Z"
cve_ids: []
disclosed_at: null
external_advisory_url: null
has_bounty?: false
id: 94333
is_external_bug: false
is_member_of_team?: false
is_participant: true
minimum_bounty: 1000
public: false
readable_substate: "New"
....
``

Here, some fields like `minimum_bounty: 1000` and relevant team details are leaked. These fields are meant for only to people to whom the team is visible.

Attack Scenario :
==============
I tested this bug on sandboxed team. But I believe this bug will affect the on going programs. Consider the scenario ...
Private Program invites a User. User submits a bug. This bug will be visible to the user via `Reports` tab. Now, team decides to remove the User and removes him/her. Now, User can still get updates of the programs via the json response. The `team information` and `bounty details` are meant for only researchers who are invited to the program and people who are part of the team. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Pranav
