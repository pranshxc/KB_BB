## Impact

An attacker can craft an ssh-ed25519 or sk-ssh-...@openssh.com public key, such that the library will panic when trying to verify a signature with it. Clients can deliver such a public key and signature to any golang.org/x/crypto/ssh server with a PublicKeyCallback, and servers can deliver them to any golang.org/x/crypto/ssh client.
