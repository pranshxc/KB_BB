## Original Report

**Hello team,**

I was checking if TRACE method is enabled on gratipay.com or not? I opened up my terminal (CLI) and executed this command: curl -v -X TRACE http://gratipay.com

The response may not actually shows it is vulnerable, but it is not as well a message for properly configured "no" to Cross Site Tracing attack.

And it showed up this response:
```
*   Trying 54.235.170.226...
* Connected to gratipay.com (54.235.170.226) port 80 (#0)
> TRACE / HTTP/1.1
> Host: gratipay.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.49.1
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 302 Found
< Server: gunicorn

< X-Cache-Lookup: NONE from cache1:8080
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< Connection: keep-alive
<
* Connection #0 to host gratipay.com left intact
```

**While, it should show this error**
```
<html>
<head><title>405 Not Allowed</title></head>
<body bgcolor="white">
<center><h1>405 Not Allowed</h1></center>

```

##PoC
We can inject headers in the response:

_Command:_ `curl -v -X TRACE -H "Header: value=Testing" http://gratipay.com/`

_Response:_
```

* Connected to gratipay.com (54.235.170.226) port 80 (#0)
> TRACE / HTTP/1.1
