# Entering passwords on the Share Login Page can lead to a brute-force attack

## Original Report

## Summary:
I have identified that when sharing the Results with a password, the request (POST method) when entering a password has no rate limit, which can then be used to loop through one request. An attacker can brute-force for a password and can get a possibly a dashboard Results.

A rate limiting algorithm is used to check if the user session (or IP-address) has to be limited based on the information in the session cache. In case a client made too many requests within a given timeframe, HTTP-Servers can respond with status code 429: Too Many Requests.

The problem here is that the sharing links are crawled, so if there is a link that does not contain a password, the account information will be revealed, and if there is a password, it can be brute-forced .

█████

## Steps To Reproduce:
1. Go to https://app.crowdsignal.com/share/███ (this my Survey)
2. Enter any password and click Login.
3. Intercept the request (you can use Burp Suite tool to do this)
4.
```
POST /share/████████/password HTTP/1.1
Host: app.crowdsignal.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/114.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

action=password&nonce=██████████&password=§
```
5. Now Send This Request To Intruder And brute-force it 1000 times with a list of 1000 passwords.
6. See that you will get a length of 297 when the password is incorrect and when you get 414 that is the correct password.
