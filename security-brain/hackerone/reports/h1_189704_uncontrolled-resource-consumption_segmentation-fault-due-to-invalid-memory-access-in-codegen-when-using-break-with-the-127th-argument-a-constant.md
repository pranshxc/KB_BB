# Segmentation fault due to invalid memory access in codegen when using break with the 127th argument a constant

## Original Report

Crash file is:

```
break 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,CRASH
```

This is 126 0's, then a constant. The 0's can be anything valid, and the constant just has to be a constant. Doesn't matter if it is defined or not. 

Causes a segfault with the following backtrace:
```

```

Looking through, looks like in `gen_values`, n loops up to 126 (on the constant node), so takes the first if block, val isn't set, so takes the else inside there, but `t->car->cdr` points to a invalid memory address so when `codegen` dereferences `tree`, it segfaults.

```

So this is showing that that 127th argument to break isn't set right. I printed out `t->car` for each `codegen` call, and it shows for the above, we get a the usual start (CFUNC, BEGIN, etc), then NODE_BREAK, followed by 126 NODE_INT's, then the segfault happens (`tree` points to invalid memory). 

I changed the constant to some other values, and found that `t->car` was clearly overflowing for other values, `0.0` (`NODE_FLOAT`), was always a value of `3157552`, rather than `52`. A `NODE_INT` varied, but one value was `-197952842`, not `51`. same with `NODE_STR`, `NODE_DSTR`, `NODE_REGX`, a *non-empty* `NODE_ARRAY`, a `NODE_FCALL`, `NODE_CALL`.... You get the picture. Weirdly only the `NODE_FLOAT` always kept the same value...

I've just found that a NODE_LVAR also crashes, such as this example crash file:

```
crash=1
break 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,crash
```


Haven't got a patch for this one yet, just wanted to file it.

Cheers,

Hugh
