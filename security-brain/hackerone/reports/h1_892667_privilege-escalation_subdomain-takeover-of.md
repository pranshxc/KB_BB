## Original Report

#Summary:
The subdomain ██████ had an CNAME record pointing to an unclaimed ███████ webservice. This is a high severity security issue because an attacker can register the subdomain on ███ and therefore can own the subdomain  █████████.



#Description:
The dangling CNAME record of █████████  is pointing to █████.███████ which was not claimed by you. I registered a service with this name and therefore was able to takeover the subdomain. Every attacker doing this has afterwards full control over the contents served on this subdomain.



#Subdomain Affected: 
██████████




#Proof Of Concept:
I have uploaded a simple subdomain takeover PoC on http://███████/████████





# Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions
1. Open ██████ and register for web app which is under market place. I have used ██████  (See: ████)

2. After registering, go to Custom Domains which will be available under settings. (See: ████)

3. In here, add custom domain i have used █████████ (See: █████)

4. After that upload any PoC you want to upload. I have used ████ which has my PoC. (See: ███████)





#Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
1. Remove the dangling CNAME record for █████

2. Claim it back in ███████ portal after I release it

#Reference
Some hackerone reports #661751 #325336

#NOTE:
I have claimed the subdomain http://█████████ at the current moment to keep it safe from malicious users. Whenever you want i will release ██████.███. Afterwards you can claim it back.

## Impact
