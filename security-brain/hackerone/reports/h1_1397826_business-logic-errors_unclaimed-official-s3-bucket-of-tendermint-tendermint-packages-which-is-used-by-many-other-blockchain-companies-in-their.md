Check your internal code if there is any usage of unclaimed s3 bucket and claim the unclaimed s3 bucket(let me know when i should unclaim it from my side)

An attacker can host its contents and malicious files on the official bucket of tendermint which can cause harm to the companies or developers using your bucket for package installation and etc. This bug has a severe impact if  it is used internally by tendermint and other companies.
