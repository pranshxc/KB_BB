## Original Report

## Open Redirect in scout24.greenhouse.io

The **Scout24 Security Team** did a penetration test against `scout24.greenhouse.io` in order to verify how Scout24 relevant data is protected against common attack vectors. Basically we have tested the (web) application against [OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project) using industry common metholodogies. 

## Reproduction steps

* Visit https://boards.greenhouse.io/scout24 and click on some job offer (I chosed [this one](https://boards.greenhouse.io/scout24/jobs/503488))
* After completing your personal information, you can *upload* some documents
	* Click `Attach` both under *Resume/CV* and *Cover Letter*
	* Upload some PDF files from your local host (in my case the file uwas called `neu.pdf`)
* In the end you send your application by clicking on `Submit Application`

Using a HTTP proxy (in my case that was [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp/)) I was able to intercept the `POST` request made by the browser before being sent to the `greenhouse.io` API. This is some sample request:

As you can notice the files have been already uploaded to `AWS` and therfore a S3 bucket links are 
used within the requests. 

## Exploitability

Using a browser and a HTTP proxy the request can be easily intercepted. In the **original** request the `Content-Disposition` parameter `job_application[cover_letter_url]` in the `POST` request contains a S3 bucket link. However, after tampering the request, the parameters values can be changed. In our specific case the value (basically an URL) could be changed to:

* a phishing site
* a site containing some malware

After intercepting the request, the parameter was modified like this:

Whenever the hiring manager will try to view the uploaded content, the application will not be able to render the content. Instead the person will then try to **download** the file by clicking on `Download` (left upper corner). Although the browser shows that the URL points to some specific `AWS` domain, the content is actually loaded from somewhere else (in this case from [https://google.com](https://google.com)). 

Again, an attacker could then submit some URL containing malicious content or some phishing site. Only for the purpose of this report, something unspectacular like [https://google.com](https://google.com) has been chosen. 

## Impact

The attack can be conducted in multiple scenarios:

* anonymous person applies for some jobs and manipulates the parameters (like described above)
* internal employee adds referal for some person and also manipulates the parameters

In both cases the hiring manager would then unknowingly access the manipulated links which could then lead to:

* installation of trojan horses / ransomeware (in general malicious content)
* a phishing site where e.g. AD credentials are claimed to be required
* CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) [attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF))

## Remediation

The affected parameter should be first validated against some regular expression (e.g. allow only links that point to `grnhse-prod-jben-*.s3.amazonaws.com`).
