## Original Report

I have identified approximately 75 Android applications (and some iPad) that fail to validate SSL certificates, either failing to validate valid certificate authorities, correct hostnames or both.

I have made attempts to responsibly disclose all of these vulns to the responsible parties. A few have been omitted from this list for various reasons.

Almost all of these could have lead to credit card and/or password disclosure.
