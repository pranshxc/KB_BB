## Original Report

###Issue:Cross-origin resource sharing: arbitrary origin trusted

The application implements an HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy for this request that allows access from any domain.

The application allowed access from the requested origin https://hhgdhgjgbrg.com

Since the Vary: Origin header was not present in the response, reverse proxies and intermediate servers may cache it. This may enable an attacker to carry out cache poisoning attacks.
**Issue background:**
An HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy controls whether and how content running on other domains can perform two-way interaction with the domain that publishes the policy. The policy is fine-grained and can apply access controls per-request based on the URL and other features of the request.

Trusting arbitrary origins effectively disables the same-origin policy, allowing two-way interaction by third-party web sites. Unless the response consists only of unprotected public content, this policy is likely to present a security risk.

If the site specifies the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true, third-party sites may be able to carry out privileged actions and retrieve sensitive information. Even if it does not, attackers may be able to bypass any IP-based access controls by proxying through users' browsers.
 **remediation:**

Host:https://www.semrush.com
Path: /blog/ws/
remediation:Rather than using a wildcard or programmatically verifying supplied origins, use a whitelist of trusted domains.
