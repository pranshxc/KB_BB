## Original Report

Hello and greetings and respect to you, dear friends

Below, we see how we found this vulnerability 
If you look carefully, we see that search in the website name Search results The gap has occurred there
as you can see POST Method  [POST https://diplomaticrooms.state.gov/?s=porcelain,%20gilt ]
now it's time to inject or generate POC with lovely tool sqlmap 
We used a text file here by Name request.txt
and this is our command in sqlmap you can use this command for your own confidence

python3 sqlmap.py -r  request --batch --random-agent --tamper=space2comment  --level=5 --risk=3 --drop-set-cookie --threads 10  --dbs
