## Original Report

Heyy there,
We have found a full read ssrf vuln in https://█████ , we were able to hit the AWS Metadata endpoint (http://███████) though the SSRF Vuln.


------------

**Steps to reproduce:**

1.Goto https://██████/users/create and create an account
2.After you account is verified , get login
If for some reasons you are not the verification code, try with a gmail id

3.Now visit: https://████/products/create/   and fill the required details
4.Once your product is created, click on `New Configuration` which is under *LRS Configurations*

████████

5.Enter this as the input for * LRS URL *: `http://█████████/latest/meta-data?` (the question mark at the end is important)
6.Under *Basic Auth User & Pass* enter test for both fields and click on `Create new LRS configuration` 

█████

7.Once the `Configuration` is created click on the `Test` button beside the conifguration name
████
8.Now you will be redirected to the homepage, so go back to the product page
9.Under `Past Results` you should be able to see a new entry
10.Click on `Manage Test record` > `Download log`
11.Now check the `Include HTTP` checkbox and from the `Log Format` drop down menu choose *Plain text*

A file with the name `log` should be downloaded in your computer, just open it and there you will find the response from the aws meta data endpoint:

```
