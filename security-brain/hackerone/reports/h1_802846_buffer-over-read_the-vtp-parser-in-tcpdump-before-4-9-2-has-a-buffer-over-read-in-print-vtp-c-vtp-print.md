## Original Report

Hello,

The vulnerable code portion is linked below. The linked function is responsible for printing VTP packet payload information to the terminal (e.g., stdout)

https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/commit/ae83295915d08a854de27a88efac5dd7353e6d3f#diff-8c6895b252e6da31d60a7866973d5787L262-L268

The issue may be reproduced as follows

Check out vulnerable tcpdump commit (< 4.9.2) as follows

```
$ git clone -b e0d8ee571438c755ff988f70886f8c4f5e9a8434 https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump
Build it with afl and AddressSanitizer as follows (please install libpcap before this step)
$ CC=afl-gcc
$ AFL_USE_ASAN=1 make -j
```

Run tcpdump against linked payload (link: https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/blob/ae83295915d08a854de27a88efac5dd7353e6d3f/tests/vtp_asan-3.pcap?raw=true)

```
$ tcpdump -nvr <payload>
