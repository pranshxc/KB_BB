## Original Report

Hello,

This bug is a design flaw in the reputation system.

Simply, when a bug is resolved `+7`  is added to the user's account. When bounty is awarded then the reputation points are calculated based on standard deviation from the program's mean.

I found these here ---> <https://hackerone.com/news/introducing-reputation>
>You gain reputation when:
Your report is Closed as Resolved: +7
Your report is Closed as Duplicate (Resolved): +2. Only applied if reported before the original was closed.
You are awarded a bounty. The amount is based on standard deviation from the program's mean:
+50: $ >= µ + 1σ
+25: $ >  µ
+15: $ >= µ - 1σ
+10: $ <  µ - 1σ
Your report is Closed as Won't Fix: +1
Your report is Closed as Duplicate (Won't Fix): +1

>You lose reputation when:
Your report is Closed as Not Applicable: -5
Your report is Closed as Duplicate (Not Applicable): -5
Your report is updated as Needs more info: -1


1. Now, one reporter can earn max of `+50` reputation points if award is far maximum than program's min bounty amount.
2. Also, when report is marked as `Resolved` then `+7` are added.
3. So, totally max of `+57` points can be made from a single bug report.

But there exists a flaw which will allow to boost reputation points more than `+57`. 
1.  A report is awarded bounty of `$350` but minimum bounty of program is `$100`. So, this adds `+50` reputation points to the reporter.
2. Now, report is marked resolved, so `+7` reputation points are added.
3. Now, if same report is awarded with bounty `$150`, then it will again add `+15`.

So, if a report is rewarded again and again then it will boost reputation points more than default `+57`. So, this totally contradicts the policy mentioned here ---> <https://hackerone.com/news/introducing-reputation>
Due to this flaw, reporter will earn more reputation points more than other researchers.
i.e If researcher two reports a severe bug then he will get `+50` and `+7`. Total of `+57`. (Total bounty 1000$)
But at the 1st researcher's report is being rewarded again and again. It will boost as `+50` and `+7` and again awarded so `+15`. Total `+72`.(Total bounty 350$ + 150$ = 500$)

I hope you understand the severity here and modify the reputation system accordingly. I found this bug on my own account. So, I am attaching an image poc of my account. Sensitive information has been forged.

Pranav
