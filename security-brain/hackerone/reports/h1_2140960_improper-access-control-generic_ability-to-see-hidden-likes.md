## Original Report

**Summary:**

Twitter/X recently added an feature that allows you to hide your likes. It's still possible to see the liked tweets via graphql API.

**Description:** 
I was testing the GraphQL API and it's still possible to view tweets.
You need to be subscribed to X premium to hide your likes. However you don't need a premium account to reproduce this vulnerability.

Twitter user with the id of `████████`has their likes hidden. However if you copy the request below and send it you will see JSON data of likes returned back to you. 

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Copy the raw http request below
  1. Paste it into your proxy (change the userId in the url if you want to test against another user. %22%3A%22████%22%2C%22 )
  1. Send the request
