## Original Report

**Summary:**
████ is a WordPress application that has several endpoints locked behind firewall, such as login screen and author names, but it can be bypassed.

**Description:**
By using additional slashes in the URL, I can bypass the firewall rules to display some WordPress information. Interestingly, these bypass only work for GET requests, but not POST requests. I have listed some of the endpoints below.

## Impact
Display names of site authors.

## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions

1. https://████████/wp-json/wp/v2/users (403 Forbidden) -> https://██████████/wp-json/wp/v2//users (200 OK)
2. https://██████/wp-login.php (403 Forbidden) -> https://██████/wp-login.php/ (200 OK) (Unfortunately POST requests are still blocked with this bypass, so testing passwords isn't possible)
3. https://█████/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword (403 Forbidden) -> https://███████/wp-login.php/?action=lostpassword (200 OK) (POST requests kinda worked with this endpoint, it showed "Access Denied" but the message came from WordPress and not the WAF/web server, which meant the request went through)

## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)
WordPress

## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
Fix the firewall rules.

## Proof of Concept
Output from wp-json/wp/v2//users
