## Original Report

**Info:**
Reflected File Download is a new web attack vector. It allows an attacker to craft a malicious file and present it to a victim, but there is no file present at the server. It was recently published at the BlackHat Eupore 2014 by Oren Hafif. Link to his presentation is given at the end.

**Pre-requisite:** To affect a user, he/she must be in a team with the attacker.

The reason being that the flaw is connected to the `triggers` page which can only be accessed by team members. 

**Preparing the injected file**
1.) We first need to create a new `trigger`.  We have 3 fields: `Criteria`, `Action` and `Options`
2.) In `Criteria` we have a text box called `text`. Populate it with the following content:
* * *
    text" || calc ||
* * *
3.) Fill the remaining boxes arbitrarily. Give any text. We have created a trigger.
4.) If we go back to our triggers page we have an option to edit this particular trigger we created. The format is as follows:
* * *
    hackerone.com/<team_name>/triggers/<numeric_id>/edit
* * *
5.) Take this link, remove the `/edit` parameter.
6.) Now if we access this link, we get a `404` saying something went wrong. But append `.bat` we will get a JSON response. Appending  `.` and any character will trigger a JSON response.

Now we have a URL with a `.bat` extension. The JSON response contains `text" || calc ||` somewhere in the middle of this JSON response. Now if we take this JSON response and paste it in a Command Prompt it would open up a calculator. We need to present this as a file. To do this we craft a page as follows:
* * *
    <html>
    <a href="https://hackerone.com/<team_name>/triggers/<numeric-id>.bat" download="anything.cmd">Click to view other user's bugs</a>
    </html>
* * *

Now once the victim clicks on the link, he is presented with a file download box. The file is shown to be from `Hackerone` itself. Upon executing the file a calculator pops up. We have numerous payloads other than `calc`. They have been discussed in the White paper of RFD. 

**Limitation:**
The issue works in Google Chrome and IE. Firefox will not prompt for a download and instead show the JSON response. It is because it does not recognize the `download` parameter in the `href` attribute.
