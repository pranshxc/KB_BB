# SQL Injection in rog.asus.com

AuthorCORBEN LEO

Published2017.11.30

### 🔎 Introduction & Background

To get started, I'll give a bit of backstory behind this. I found this bug back in **January** of 2017 and was one of the first reports I made to a company. I was bored back in January so I decided to hunt for bugs in *.asus.com. After about an hour I came across rog.asus.com and I noticed that it also had a forum on it. It was running vBulletin 4.2.3. I did a bit of research and found that forumrunner, a core module enabled by default, was vulnerable to SQL Injection in this version.

#### 😕 What is ForumRunner?

> Forum Runner is a vBulletin, XenForo, myBB, and phpBB forum add-on that allows your users to access your forum at blazing fast speeds by using a native application installed on their mobile phone

#### How is it vulnerable?

> vBulletin's code standards use clean_gpc() and clean_array_gpc() functions to sanitize input data, so PHP superglobal arrays are not accessed directly. I would use the word "sanitize" very loosely here, as this vulnerability has just proven that these sanitizing functions are simply not enough.

So it all comes down to `/forumrunner/includes/moderation.php`
  
  
  function do_get_spam_data() {
  global $vbulletin, $db, $vbphrase;
  
  
  $vbulletin->input->clean_array_gpc('r', array(
  'threadid' => TYPE_STRING,
  'postids' => TYPE_STRING,
  ));
  
  ------ snip ------
  
  } else if ($vbulletin->GPC['postids'] != ") {
  $postids = $vbulletin->GPC['postids'];
  
  $posts = $db->query_read_slave("
  SELECT post.postid, post.threadid, post.visible, post.title, post.userid,
  thread.forumid, thread.title AS thread_title, thread.postuserid, thread.visible AS thread_visible, thread.firstpostid
  FROM " . TABLE_PREFIX . "post AS post
  LEFT JOIN " . TABLE_PREFIX . "thread AS thread USING (threadid)
  WHERE postid IN ($postids)
  ");

So both `postids` and `threadid` are filtered as a TYPE_STRING, placed into an array (`$vbulletin->GPC`), and then added to the database. TYPE_STRING filtered variables are not protected from SQL Injection.

This is makes the forumrunner module vulnerable to both MySQL boolean-based blind and time-based blind injection.

### 😋 Exploitation

So I checked if ASUS had applied the patch by visiting: `https://rog.asus.com/forum/forumrunner/request.php?d=1&cmd=get_spam_data&postids=1'` and an SQL error was thrown! I threw it into SQLMAP as one does (I suck at manual exploitation of SQL Injection, mainly because I haven't ever gotten past getting some basic info from `UNION ALL SELECT`), however there was a WAF in place so I couldn't extract any data whatsoever. I went to [censys.io](https://censys.io) and searched 'Republic of Gamers' and quickly found the backend IP of the server, in hopes that this would bypass the WAF.

I ran:
  
  
  sqlmap -u "http://103.10.4.162/forum/forumrunner/request.php?d=1&cmd=get_spam_data&postids=1*" --random-agent -threads=10 --level 5 --dbs

and it listed out all of the databases on the site! I had successfully bypassed the WAF. I reported it and they patched it within 2 days. Sadly they didn't have any sort of bounty, but it was still fun!
