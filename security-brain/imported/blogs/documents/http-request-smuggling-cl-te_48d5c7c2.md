# [HTTP Request Smuggling (CL.TE)](https://memn0ps.github.io/http-request-smuggling-cl-te/)

Persistence is key, do it for the learning, not for the bounty ;)

Quick note:

Not all bounties are a success, this is a story about how I tried harder when failing. (As full time Security Consultant I spent my own time on this which was about 1 week and I don’t regret the learning experience) To make this process easier I’d recommend using the Burp plugin “HTTP Request Smuggler”. I used that plugin and tried manually too but I just didn’t take any screenshots of the plugin. It would be a pain if you didn’t use this Burp plugin for TE.CL.

I ran out of time as the target was taken off from Synack but I spent most of the time on bypassing the backend, however I tried/attempted all of the following: (some worked, some didn’t plus I ran out of time)

  * Using HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls
  * Revealing front-end request rewriting
  * Capturing other users’ requests
  * Using HTTP request smuggling to exploit reflected XSS
  * Using HTTP request smuggling to turn an on-site redirect into an open redirect
  * Using HTTP request smuggling to perform web cache poisoning
  * Using HTTP request smuggling to perform web cache deception

(For more information please refer to Portswigger’s blog)

I highly recommend finishing all the labs so you don’t have to go back and forth like me :p

### Background#

HTTP request smuggling CL.TE is a web application vulnerability which allows an attacker to smuggle multiple HTTP request by tricking the front-end (load balancer or reverse proxy) to forward multiple HTTP requests to a back-end server over the same network connection and the protocol used for the back-end connections carries the risk that the two servers disagree about the boundaries between requests. In CL.TE the front-end server uses the Content-Length header and the back-end server uses the Transfer-Encoding header.

### Detail#

I found my first HTTP request smuggling CL.TE attack on Synack Red Team which was confirmed from the request shown in `Figure 1`.

![screenshot1](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot1.png) **Figure 1: Status code 404, Not Found**

The first thing that came to mind is to make a successful request to see the response to give me another confirmation shown in `Figure 2`.

![screenshot2](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot2.png) **Figure 2: Status code 200, OK**

The next thing I added was localhost to the Host header, however there seemed to be a problem as shown in `Figure 3`.

(I tried many other things too, not just robots.txt)

![screenshot3](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot3.png) **Figure 3: Status code 403, Forbidden**

In the Synack description and based on the IP address the target was using AWS EC2 instance. I then happily to tried to access the `/latest/meta-data/` and changed the Host header to `169.254.169.254`, which is an AWS IP address for accessing internal resources.

![screenshot4](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot4.png) **Figure 4: Attempting to get /latest/meta-data/**

I soon realised that I hadn’t finished the entire Web Security Academy exercises so I decided to go back and do some more research.

After a bit of research I soon realised that Portswigger blog mentioned that the request can be blocked due to the second request’s Host header conflicting with the smuggled Host header in the first request.

I then issued the request shown in `Figure 5` so the second request’s headers are appended to the smuggled request body instead and don’t conflict with each other.

![screenshot5](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot5.png) **Figure 5: Status code 403, Forbidden, attempted to append the GET request to the smuggled request’s body**

I also tried the request to `/latest/meta-data/` as shown in `Figure 6` which failed.

![screenshot6](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot6.png) **Figure 6: Attempt to get meta-data**

By now I had tried a lot of requests which failed. Normally this would work depending on the web application. I decided to do more labs and more research.

### Revealing front-end request rewriting#

I then came across revealing front-end request rewriting.

In many of the web application the front-end (load balancer or reverse proxy) might rewrite requests prior to being sent to the backend server, usually by adding extra headers to HTTP requests.

These headers could be:

  * terminate the TLS connection and add some headers describing the protocol and ciphers that were used;
  * add an X-Forwarded-For header containing the user’s IP address;
  * determine the user’s ID based on their session token and add a header identifying the user; or
  * add some sensitive information that is of interest for other attacks.

In some cases HTTP request smuggling will fail if some of these headers are missing as the back-end server might not process these requests in a way it normally does.

You can leak these headers using the following steps:

  * Find a POST request that reflects the value of a request parameter into the application’s response.
  * Shuffle the parameters so that the reflected parameter appears last in the message body.
  * Smuggle this request to the back-end server, followed directly by a normal request whose rewritten form you want to reveal.

So I performed the steps above and leaked the headers, at this point I was pretty happy as this was a step forward after some research, `Figure 7`.

![screenshot7](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot7.png) **Figure 7: Leaking front-end headers**

This is what the headers looked like when they were decoded.
  
  
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  X-Forwarded-For: X.X.X.X
  X-Forwarded-Proto: https
  X-Forwarded-Port: 443
  Host: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  X-Amzn-Trace-Id: Root=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  Content-Length: 1028
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/71.0.3578.98 Safari/537.36
  Accept: text/html,application/xhtml xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Transfer-Encoding : chunked
  0
  

So I attempted all possible combinations with the headers, even the ones that did not make sense. I had spent almost one week on this vulnerability, researching it, doing the labs, attempting to do it on the target etc….

As you can see whenever I add the Host header without the name of the target, it gives me 403. Otherwise resources such as meta-data give me 404 and resources such as robots.txt give me 200 (with targets name in Host header).

![screenshot8](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot8.png) **Figure 8: Status code 404 not found after attempting to add all headers**

As soon as I changed the header to something other than the targets name, once again 403 even for something like robots.txt

![screenshot9](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot9.png) **Figure 9: Status code, 403 Forbidden, after attempting to play around with headers.**

AT LAST! I did something different here, I changed the protocol from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0 on both requests and I got a 302 Found.

I was redirected to SSO and it took me to a login portal, the server was publicly accessible too however it requires SAML to take you to the login portal I believe.

![screenshot10](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot10.png) **Figure 10: Status code 302 Found, SSO**

Here is the login portal:

![screenshot11](/HTTP-Request-Smuggling-CL-TE/screenshot11.png) **Figure 11: Login Portal**

It seems that the backend requires some sort of authentication (maybe?) in order to access internal resources which sounds like a rare case but could be possible. What are your thoughts?… Hope this helps.

I have submitted the bug (lower impact than usual) and received a bounty, thank you Synack :)

### Recommendations ([From PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling))#

  * Disable reuse of back-end connections, so that each back-end request is sent over a separate network connection.
  * Use HTTP/2 for back-end connections, as this protocol prevents ambiguity about the boundaries between requests.
  * Use exactly the same web server software for the front-end and back-end servers, so that they agree about the boundaries between requests.
