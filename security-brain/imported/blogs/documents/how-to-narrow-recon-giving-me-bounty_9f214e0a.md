# How to narrow recon giving me $$$$ Bounty

17 Apr 2023 • Mohammad Zaheri • [Writeups] [Web]

## Introduction

In this writeup, I explain how to get 4 digit bounty with web applications recon and I hope this article will be helpful for you.

## Program Scope and technologies

In the past month in invited to a private program in HackerOne, i usually work on a program with limited scope, and this program just has a sandbox domain: (sandbox.target.tld) and they started the bounty program in Q1 of 2022, I pick up the domain and open my BurpSuite

## Recon

I signed up using my alias email. after quickly browsing the web application i saw my BurpSuite history, all requests are GraphQL POST method request. I understood finding Bugs in this program is hard but i never give up.

### Patience and discipline is a key

after clicking every item on the site and working with it, i understand how the application works. The interesting part was that the application send a GET request to `GET /api/auth/csrf` endpoint for getting new csrf token every 60 minutes. this endpoint vulnerable to [Web Cache Deception Attack](https://omergil.blogspot.com/2017/02/web-cache-deception-attack.html), but in not really impactful

I decided to find an endpoint that would return sensitive information and started fuzzing the `GET /api/auth/FUZZ` endpoint after some time i found interesting endpoint which returns sensitive information and vulnerable to Web Cache Deception Attack

with this endpoint i can access the all user information and api keys

I reported that to the program and they triaged it as critical
